The question then becomes, how does the quest structure influence the story structure? How do the limitations of the quest combinations limit the kinds of story that are possible? How rich can the imposed story be, without breaking the gameplay? Are landscape and quest-structure the dominant factors in quest game design, to which the story-ambitions must defer? The main thesis of the paper is that if we understand the powerful but simple structure - the grammar - of quests (how they work, how they are used) we can understand both the limits and the potential of these kinds of games.},

	abstract = {Computer games are undoubtedly the most diverse and fast- changing cultural genre that ever existed. And perhaps most importantly, computer games represent a new mode of aesthetic as well as social discourse, an alternative to the narrative, which has been the leading paradigm until now: the primary means to convey knowledge and experience. Now, however, the mode of simulation is sued as an effective pedagogical tool that privileges active experimentation with its subject material rather than observation. Simulation is also a way to explore the partly unknown, to test models and hypotheses, and thus to construct and acquire new knowledge in a way narrative never could. The article at hand defends the claim that spatiality is a central theme in computer games. It starts by expanding this claim: Spatiality is the defining element in computer games. They are essentially concerned with spatial representation and negotiation, and therefore a classification of computer games can be based on how they represent space.},

Building on Hans-Georg Gadamer{\textquoteright}s notion of games as a subject that {\textquotedblleft}masters the players{\textquotedblright}, the paper will go beyond the traditional split between the social sciences{\textquoteright} real players and the aesthetics/humanities critical author-as-player, and present a theory of the player and player studies that incorporates the complex tensions between the real, historical player and the game{\textquoteright}s human components. Since games are both aesthetic and social phenomena, a theory of the player must combine both social and aesthetic perspectives to be successful. The tension between the humanities and the social sciences over who controls the idea of the player can be found mirrored also in the struggle between the player as individual and the {\textquotedblleft}player function{\textquotedblright} of the game. Transgressive play, the struggle against the game{\textquoteright}s ideal player, far from being a marginal, romanticized phenomenon, is the core expression of this struggle.},

You are not a citizen of any recognized country, and your daily life contains crossing checkpoints and encountering occupation soldiers and violent fanatic settlers. Or maybe you are a young soldier doing her mandatory military service in the occupation forces, or a journalist specializing in the North European conflict, or a human rights activist who has come here to stand in solidarity with the Finns. The purpose of the game is to mirror the current situation of Palestine in Finland and give the players a picture of everyday life under occupation.},

The paper discusses several examples that are illustrative of these trends, such as computer games and artistic presentations. Although this analysis does not downplay the problematic and negative features of current surveillance practices, it aims to accentuate some of the ways in which surveillance-enabling technologies are able to perform entertainment functions.},

	abstract = {For all the critical attention paid to dystopian landscapes in recent literature and film, a similar dystopian turn within gamespace has been largely overlooked. The authors contend that post-apocalyptic digital games merit the same critical examination as their literary and cinematic counterparts, arguing that such games can provide a meaningful site in which questions about the future of technology play out against the dialectic of utopian and dystopian alternatives. Specifically, this article argues that the popular console game BioShock simultaneously celebrates and interrogates utopian notions of technological progress and free will embedded within prevailing industrial and academic conceptions of convergence. The authors explore the differing, yet complementary, conceptions of utopia put forth by critical theorists and the games industry in order to examine how BioShock\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}s ambivalence toward technology\{{\textbackslash}textendash\}-and technologies and practices of media consumption in particular\{{\textbackslash}textendash\}-complicates more idealistic and totalizing forecasts for the future of media convergence. Building upon Alexander Galloway\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}s treatment of gamic action as an \{{\textbackslash}textquoteleft\}\{{\textbackslash}textquoteleft\}allegorithm\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\} that permits procedural exploration and mastery of dominant control protocols in the information age, the authors analyze the way in which BioShock operationalizes the \{{\textbackslash}textquoteleft\}\{{\textbackslash}textquoteleft\}control\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\} logic of convergence. By performing a close reading of the game\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}s ideological content as well as its procedural strategies of transmediation, they link BioShock\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}s ambivalence to the multifaceted, often conflicting nature of convergence discourse and practice within the digital games industry.},

	abstract = {In this article, I argue that the first-person shooter video game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, reflects the U.S. military{\textquoteright}s transition as it reimagines the soldier{\textquoteright}s role in war. In the age of drone technology, this role shifts from a position of strength to one of relative weakness. Although video games that feature future combat often {\textquotedblleft}function as virtual enactments and endorsements for developing military technologies,{\textquotedblright} Black Ops II offers a surprisingly complex vision of the future of drones and U.S. soldiers (Smicker 2009: 107). To explore how the game reflects a contemporary vision of the U.S. military, I weave together a close textual reading of two levels in Black Ops II with actual accounts from drone pilots and politicians that illuminate the nature of drone combat. Although there are moments in Black Ops II in which avatars combat enemies with first-hand firepower, the experience of heroic diegetic violence is superseded by a combat experience defined by powerlessness, boredom, and ambiguous pleasure. The shift of the soldier from imposing hero to a banal figure experiences its logical conclusion in Unmanned, an independent video game that foregrounds the mundane, nonviolent nature of drone piloting. Instead of training soldiers to withstand emotionally devastating experiences of death and violence first-hand (or to physically enact such violence), games like Black Ops II and Unmanned train actual and potential soldiers to tolerate monotony and disempowerment.},

With the point of departure in space/mobility and everyday life practices - the common denominators in the perspectives of transnationalism and mediatisation - the analysis shows that mediated deterritorialisation is conditional due to migrants' sociocultural resources and earlier life experiences. Hence, experiences of war and conflict may reduce the potential of mediated mobilities. The article demonstrates how media are an integrated part of migrants' multiple identifications with the city they reside in and their country of origin. Besides establishing multiple identifications, the article shows how these identities are linked to particular contexts, practices and socialities in the migrants' everyday lives. The conclusion is that mediatisation and transnationalism are complex matters yet a transdisciplinary, contextual and non-media-centric' approach seems to be a promising way to grasp these complexities.},

Despite their significant contribution to the overall play experience, they are often neglected by the game research community. Conventional game theories such as ludology and narratology do not provide an insightful account of the sociocultural aspects of game play. Therefore, in this article, we report our observations and investigations into different forms of extrinsic play activities in an online virtual setting. Founded on activity theory, we articulate theoretical models that explicate game play in a sociocultural context. Our findings reveal that extrinsic play constitutes reflective play and expansive play, which transform the play activity and transport the players beyond the original boundary of play.},

We focus on the definition of embodiment that refers to the ways in which abstract concepts rely on metaphorical extensions of embodied schemata shaped by processes below the level of conscious awareness as explored by Lakoff and Johnson [Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., 1980. Metaphors We Live By. Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, USA]. Our inquiry focuses on understanding the role embodied metaphors may play in supporting people to understand the possibilities for physical interaction in augmented spaces. We explore this issue through the development and evaluation of an interactive audio environ- ment. We instantiate metaphor theory by using embodied schemata as the basis for the interactional metaphor that relates full-body input actions to audio output responses. We demonstrate and explore the benefits of this approach through a comparative experiment in which adults and children learn to use our audio environment. The results from our experiment indicated that embodied metaphors improve usability however, other factors including discoverability, perceivability of feedback and duplic- ity of structural isomorphism may mediate these metaphor-based benefits. We have generalized our main findings as a set of suggestions for the design of embodied style interfaces that rely on physical interaction.},

	doi = {10.1177/1046878105282278},
	abstract = {This article examines the notion of genre in video games. The main argument is that the market-based categories of genre that have been developed in the context of video games obscure the new medium's crucial defining feature, by dividing them into categories (loosely) organized by their similarities to prior forms of mediation. The article explores the inherent tension between the conception of video games as a unified new media form, and the current fragmented genre-based approach that explicitly or implicitly concatenates video games with prior media forms. This tension reflects the current debate, within the fledgling discipline of Game Studies, between those who advocate narrative as the primary tool for understanding video games, "narratologists," and those that oppose this notion, "ludologists." In reference to this tension, the article argues that video game genres be examined in order to assess what kind of assumptions stem from the uncritical acceptance of genre as a descriptive category. Through a critical examination of the key game genres, this article will demonstrate how the clearly defined genre boundaries collapse to reveal structural similarities between the genres that exist within the current genre system, defined within the context of visual aesthetic or narrative structure. The inability of the current genre descriptions to locate and highlight these particular features suggests that to privilege the categories of the visual and narrative is a failure to understand the medium. The article concludes by suggesting that the tension between "ludology" and "narratology" can be more constructively engaged by conceptualizing video games as operating in the interplay between these two taxonomies of genre.},

	url = {http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-39-6164-0},
	abstract = {Digital games are a relatively new medium. While they have been around for over half a century, they only became a major part of the culture relatively late. Like every other medium before, games also have struggled to find an expressive language of their own. Some of the expressive styles of other media are still relevant for games, but new ones have to be created specifically for videogames. This dissertation is a study of how ludonarrative videogames, videogames that combine game elements with narrative elements, express and convey meaning. This is done as part of game studies, a multidisciplinary approach to studying games. The purpose is twofold: to build a foundation for better under- standing of meaning-making in games, and to provide game designers with tools for analyzing issues related to meaning. This study uses philosophical tools to analyze meaning in games. The philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer is used to compare the meaning-making in games to the interpretation of works of art. The theory of the interpretive process is based on the idea of the hermeneutic circle. Wittgen- stein{\textquoteright}s concept of language-games is used in examining how games should be defined and how their relations to each other should be understood. These philosophical methods are combined with the study of procedurality, narrativi- ty and players. This study shows that ludonarrative games are procedural systems that are interpreted both during gameplay and as a part of the surrounding cultural context. The result of this interpretation is neither predetermined by the game designer nor fixed during gameplay, but potentially open for endless reinter- pretation as players interact with the game in new ways and as the cultural con- text changes. In order to convey meaning, ludonarrative games can borrow ex- pressive tools from other media, for example by using perspective in the way it is used in cinema. Additionally, this study provides guidelines for designing meaning. It is shown how meaning can be used as a game mechanic, and how games contain unique ways of expressing things that would be hard to convey in other media.},

	abstract = {Games have been defined and redefined many times over, and there seems to be no end to this continual process or any agreement about the definitions. This article argues that such an agreement is not necessary, and presents a Wittgensteinian approach to discussing game definitions. Instead of the common core approach used in most definitions, this article argues for an approach based on language-games. The common core approach is based on a limited number of shared core attributes, while the language-game approach is based on the idea of family resemblances. The language-game approach sees the cycle of redefinition as a hermeneutic circle that advances our understanding of games. This article also clarifies the distinction between nominal and real definitions and shows how they serve different purposes. With the approach suggested here, the focus in research can shift from the essential attributes of games to understanding definitions as tools for practical purposes.},

	url = {http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/public-policy/2017_usacm_statement_algorithms.pdf},
	abstract = {Computer algorithms are widely employed throughout our economy and society to make decisions that have far-reaching impacts, including their applications for education, access to credit, healthcare, and employment.1 The ubiquity of algorithms in our everyday lives is an important reason to focus on addressing challenges associated with the design and technical aspects of algorithms and preventing bias from the onset. An algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations that computers and other 'smart' devices carry out to perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks. Increasingly, algorithms implement institutional decision-making based on analytics, which involves the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. Especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming, and operations research to quantify performance. There is also growing evidence that some algorithms and analytics can be opaque, making it impossible to determine when their outputs may be biased or erroneous. Computational models can be distorted as a result of biases contained in their input data and/or their algorithms. Decisions made by predictive algorithms can be opaque because of many factors, including technical (the algorithm may not lend itself to easy explanation), economic (the cost of providing transparency may be excessive, including the compromise of trade secrets), and social (revealing input may violate privacy expectations). Even well-engineered computer systems can result in unexplained outcomes or errors, either because they contain bugs or because the conditions of their use changes, invalidating assumptions on which the original analytics were based. The use of algorithms for automated decision-making about individuals can result in harmful discrimination. Policymakers should hold institutions using analytics to the same standards as institutions where humans have traditionally made decisions and developers should plan and architect analytical systems to adhere to those standards when algorithms are used to make automated decisions or as input to decisions made by people. This set of principles, consistent with the ACM Code of Ethics, is intended to support the benefits of algorithmic decision-making while addressing these concerns. These principles should be addressed during every phase of system development and deployment to the extent necessary to minimize potential harms while realizing the benefits of algorithmic decision-making. Principles for Algorithmic Transparency and Accountability 1. Awareness: Owners, designers, builders, users, and other stakeholders of analytic systems should be aware of the possible biases involved in their design, implementation, and use and the potential harm that biases can cause to individuals and society. 2. Access and redress: Regulators should encourage the adoption of mechanisms that enable questioning and redress for individuals and groups that are adversely affected by algorithmically informed decisions. 3. Accountability: Institutions should be held responsible for decisions made by the algorithms that they use, even if it is not feasible to explain in detail how the algorithms produce their results. 4. Explanation: Systems and institutions that use algorithmic decision-making are encouraged to produce explanations regarding both the procedures followed by the algorithm and the specific decisions that are made. This is particularly important in public policy contexts. 5. Data Provenance: A description of the way in which the training data was collected should be maintained by the builders of the algorithms, accompanied by an exploration of the potential biases induced by the human or algorithmic data-gathering process. Public scrutiny of the data provides maximum opportunity for corrections. However, concerns over privacy, protecting trade secrets, or revelation of analytics that might allow malicious actors to game the system can justify restricting access to qualified and authorized individuals. 6. Auditability: Models, algorithms, data, and decisions should be recorded so that they can be audited in cases where harm is suspected. 7. Validation and Testing: Institutions should use rigorous methods to validate their models and document those methods and results. In particular, they should routinely perform tests to assess and determine whether the model generates discriminatory harm. Institutions are encouraged to make the results of such tests public.},

It is also leaving its mark on the dynamics of popular contention. Political protest traditionally relied heavily on claims makers' gathering in the streets to contest power holders. The Internet is altering this dynamic by electronically promoting the diffusion of protest ideas and tactics efficiently and quickly across the globe. Less concerned with such constraints as time and geographic space, it has caught policymakers off guard with its ease of public accessibility and immediacy of impact. This cyber-diffusion, however, has a cautionary side: while significantly enhancing the potential for disparate individuals and groups to collectively pool resources and strategy, the Internet also holds the power to turn unreliable and unverifiable information into a global electronic riot.},

The release of new games or game-playing equipment, such as the PlayStation 2, generates great excitement and even buying frenzies. Yet, until now, this giant on the popular culture landscape has received little in-depth study or analysis. In this book, Mark J. P. Wolf and four other scholars conduct the first thorough investigation of the video game as an artistic medium. The book begins with an attempt to define what is meant by the term ""video game"" and the variety of modes of production within the medium. It moves on to a brief history of the video game, then applies the tools of film studies to look at the medium in terms of the formal aspects of space, time, narrative, and genre. The book also considers the video game as a cultural entity, object of museum curation, and repository of psychological archetypes. It closes with a list of video game research resources for further study.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {The monitoring of children in time and space, from a distance via mobile phones, is a phenomenon never experienced in previous generations. Indeed, as frequently recited, the increased protection of children by monitoring them is a central characteristic of modern childhood (Rasmussen 2004; Qvortrup 1993) and the effects of this are not yet known. Equally, our understanding of how children in middle childhood (8 {\textendash} 12 years) negotiate and or resist this monitoring is unclear. This paper seeks to add to the emerging body of knowledge from an anthropological perspective on the strategies employed by children in middle childhood to negotiate and resist the monitoring and surveillance of their physical selves in time and space using mobile phones predominantly. I suggest that the mobile phone can be transformed by children into a highly efficient device to enable them to both negotiate and resist surveillance thus increasing their autonomy and independent mobility. Children are not passive recipients of parental surveillance and power, rather they are increasingly playing an active role in negotiation with parents and actively resist monitoring of their everyday lives.},

	abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

Theories of grounded cognition are also reviewed, as are origins of the area and common misperceptions of it.

Analysis of various definitions for game provided by both professional game designers and academics allows the identification of distinct aesthetic camps.

Collectively, these aesthetic posi- tions outline an answer to the question raised by Mary Midgley{\textquoteright}s observation that games and art can be unified because they deal with human needs that necessarily have a structure. This article provides a rough sketch of the shape of human play needs and asserts that the unity that can thus be attained must necessarily be diverse.},

Based on the examination of zero-player games, we provide five subcomponents to help in the understanding of the player concept. Expressed as questions, these are: Is this a human player? Does the player have agency? Does the player play over time? Does the player appear to have intentionality? Does the player exhibit aesthetic preferences?},

	abstract = {The present paper evaluates the claim that abstract conceptual domains are structured through metaphorical mappings from domains grounded directly in experience. In particular, the paper asks whether the abstract domain of time gets its relational structure from the more concrete domain of space. Relational similarities between space and time are outlined along with several explanations of how these similarities may have arisen. Three experiments designed to distinguish between these explanations are described. The results indicate that (1) the domains of space and time do share conceptual structure, (2) spatial relational information is just as useful for thinking about time as temporal information, and (3) with frequent use, mappings between space and time come to be stored in the domain of time and so thinking about time does not necessarily require access to spatial schemas. These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence for Metaphoric Structuring. It appears that abstract domains such as time are indeed shaped by metaphorical mappings from more concrete and experiential domains such as space.},

	abstract = {Much of the current research in the field of role-playing studies focuses upon the positive impact that games can have on the lives of participants. Analysis of the more negative social interactions within role-playing communities becomes necessary in order to establish a more complete picture of the psychosocial effects of these games. This research describes potential problems within role-playing communities in order to aid groups experiencing cohesion difficulties. This thematic, qualitative ethnography describes the types of social conflict occurring within role-playing groups and examines possible sources for their exacerbation. The study includes several types of role-playing from a phenomenological perspective, including tabletop, larp, and virtual gaming. Semi-structured interviews were collected from a selective sample of 30 international participants gathered from vastly different play cultures. While the types of games and methods of play contributed to conflict in some instances, striking similarities between the experiences of players across modes, cultures, and genres were observed. Emergent themes for sources of conflict included general problems inherent to group behavior, such as schisms, Internet communication, and intimate relationships. Other sources of conflict unique to the role-playing experience included creative agenda differences, the game master/player power differential, and the phenomenon of bleed, both in- and out-of-game. Potentially conflict-inducing play styles included long-term immersion into character, campaign-style, and competitive play.},

With the use of a big data tool (Wisdom), we explored gender disparities in various Facebook liking practices concerning expressions of civic engagement among 21,706,806 Facebook users in 10 countries across Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe. We observed distinct patterns with regard to civic and political expressions on Facebook, with males drawn more toward politically and information-oriented liking practices when compared to females. Moreover, females (aged 13-28 years) in Europe and the Americas are more likely than males to support humanitarian aid and environmental issues on Facebook. This latter finding was not evident in Asia and Africa, where males are more active in liking all forms of civic expressions on Facebook. In conclusion, this study shows that the gender differences in civic engagement that exist offline to a large degree are replicated and reinforced on Facebook.},

	abstract = {This article examines the cultural fabric of national identity in light of recent debates in the human sciences on the nature of texts and {\textquotedblleft}textual realities.{\textquotedblright} In discussing various political and historical examples, it argues that conceiving of national identity as a {\textquotedblleft}textual reality{\textquotedblright} is to understand it (a) as a symbolic construction, (b) as a process of continuous cultural interpretation and reinterpretation, (c) as semiotic mediation, and (d) as a heterogeneous composition of different, often contradictory, layers of meaning. Although these issues have been discussed in different disciplines and theoretical contexts, they are viewed here as aspects of the same phenomenon, reflecting, each in its way, the conceptual scope of the textual approach. In further developing this argument, the article outlines a concept of text that covers not only linguistic phenomena in the traditional sense but also meaningful structures in a larger, cultural sense: symbolic spaces that embrace several semiotic media. Based on the idea of text as a symbolic space, a concept of national identity is suggested that, although it implies viewing identity as a discursive and narrative construction, is not limited to the mode of linguistic storytelling but also includes narrative media such as architecture, landscape design, cultural traditions such as commemorative rituals, and other symbolic and material practices.},

Advanced and tested herein is the inadvertency thesis, which theorizes that limitations of selective exposure processes combined with weakened social boundaries found in the online environment suggest that people may be exposed to at least some additional political difference online, if only inadvertently. Hierarchical regression and mediation analyses confirm that online political discussion (directly) and online news (directly and indirectly) bear small yet significant relationships to the overall heterogeneity of political discussion networks, and that partisanship moderates the relationship between online political discussion and political discussion network heterogeneity.},

The {\textquoteleft}crotch salute{\textquoteright}, {\textquoteleft}left-hand salute{\textquoteright}, and {\textquoteleft}Veterans Day non-salute{\textquoteright} serve as case studies for understanding the role of trolling in the public sphere and Internet politics in an era of social networks and circulation. This paper tracks the cultural practices and logics of {\textquoteleft}sharing{\textquoteright} political memes and conceptualises memes as part of an agonistic public sphere and media ecology. Obama trolling is facilitated through the techno-cultural affordances of memes, which can only become public because of their mimetic form and sterilised partial anonymity. The paper seeks to conceptualise trolling as a broader cultural practice, which can be considered political. Normative assumptions about these memes would portray this trafficking as destructive to deliberative democracy but when understood as a generative cultural practice, trolling becomes central to articulating political emotions in social networks. Photo-shopped Obama salutes, in addition to Big Bird, binder, and bayonet memes, express not only political identities but also larger cultural values within networked popular culture.},

	title = {Narrative {Involvement} in {Digital} {Games}},
	abstract = {This paper claims that the spirited debates about game narratives in the game industry and academia have not seen much progress due to their being too stuck in classical notions of narrative developed for non-ergodic media such as film or literature. The argument forwarded here is, therefore, that we need to re- conceptualize our notion of narrative considerably in order for the concept to be productive in the context of games. This re- conceptualization needs to take into account the cybernetic nature of games and thus factor in the experiential dimension of the human as well as the formal properties of the game. Due to length limitations the paper will focus primarily on the experiential side of the game/player equation. This dimension has, so far, presented considerable difficulties in finding a solid theoretical model upon which to be based, resulting in overly vague conceptualizations thereof. This paper builds on the Player Involvement Model described in Calleja{\textquoteright}s In-Game:From Immersion to Incorporation, in order to arrive at a solid framework for understanding experiential narrative in games.},

	title = {Incorporation: {A} {Renewed} {Understanding} of {Presence} and {Immersion} in {Digital} {Games} .},
	abstract = {Virtual worlds are enabling experiences that were not previously available through other media. One such experience is the potential to have a sense of inhabiting the simulated spaces they offer, not just through the use of the player{\textquoteright}s imaginative faculty, but also through the cybernetic circuit between player and machine. This phenomenon has been described by the terms {\textquotedblleft}presence{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}immersion{\textquotedblright}. Although the two terms are used in various fields and have been discussed for three decades, there seems to be a lack of consensus as to what either of them actually refers to (Ermi and Mayra, 2005; King and Krzywinska, 2006; Tamborini and Skalski, 2006; Brown and Cairns, 2004; Jennett et al., 2008). Of the two terms, immersion is particularly awkward because it has also been applied to the experiences of non-ergodic media such as painting (Grau, 2003), literature (Nell, 1988), and cinema (Bazin, 1967), all of which provide qualitatively different forms of engagement than game environments. Nevertheless the phenomenon these two terms try to describe is crucial to our understanding of the relationship between user and virtual world, as it represents one end of a continuum of intensity of involvement with virtual worlds and addresses the very notion of being in the context of such simulated environments. In this paper I claim that the confusion and apprehension surrounding the use of these two terms is based on a number of challenges they pose to a clear understanding of the phenomenon they have been employed to describe. The paper takes digital games as the most popular and experientially powerful forms of virtual worlds and thus uses them as its primary exemplar. The radical stance taken here will be to claim that this confusion arises because neither metaphor adequately describes the relationship between player and game. Both assume a uni-directional dive of human subjectivity into a containing vessel; a split between the physical {\textquotedblleft}here{\textquotedblright} and the virtual {\textquotedblleft}there{\textquotedblright} that is overcome temporarily when the phenomenon is experienced. I will further argue for a more precise and conceptually productive approach views the virtual world assimilated into the user{\textquoteright}s consciousness as a space that affords the exertion of agency and expression of sociality in a manner coextensive with our everyday reality. The metaphors of presence and immersion are therefore replaced with the notion of incorporation: an experiential phenomenon that accounts for the simultaneous assimilation into consciousness of the virtual world and the systemic acknowledgement of the player{\textquoteright}s location and existence therein. This turns the concept of a uni-directional plunge into the virtual on its head, and instead posits the virtual as a productive aspect of contemporary reality which is having a profound impact on notions of identity and sociality exactly because of this increasingly more seamless integration of simulated worlds and globally connected minds.},

We hypothesized that a player will feel a higher sense of agency when making a choice if they foresee the available actions lead to meaningfully dif- ferent states.We experimentally tested our formalism{\textquoteright}s ability to characterize choices that elicit a higher sense of agency and present evidence that supports our claim. Study participants (n = 88) played a choose-your-own- adventure game and reported a higher sense of agency when faced with choices that differed in situational con- tent over choices that didn{\textquoteright}t, despite these choices dif- fering in non-situational ways.We contend our findings are a step toward principled approaches to the design of interactive stories that target specific cognitive and affective states.

On the contrary, I find the pre-critical works interesting both in their own right and for understanding the origins of Kant's celebrated critical system of philosophy. I also believe that, from his very first writings, the pre-critical Kant broke from both Leibniz and Wolff. The second myth is that Kant, as the paradigm of "Enlightenment rationality" either ignored or evinced a hostile disdain for philospohical issues connected with our embodiment. Although I am sympatethic with the feminist critics who push this line, I believe that in this case they are dead wrong. Despite appereances, Kant was very much concerned with the philosophical significance of embodiment. I think that this concern manifested itself throughout Kant's career, although I admit that it is most evident in the relatively litle-know early and late works.},

Gaming preferences certainly relate to the attributes of particular games, but they will also depend on the player's recognition and knowledge of these attributes. Players accumulate these competencies according to the patterns of access and peer culture they encounter. The constituents of preference, such as access, are shaped by gender, and as a result, gaming preferences may manifest along gendered lines. It is not difficult to generate data, indicating that gendered tastes exist, but it is shortsighted to separate such outcomes from the various practices that contribute to their formation.},

It is argued that due to the particular nature of digital games, both structural analysis and textual analysis are relevant to game studies. Unfortunately they tend to be conflated. Neither structural nor textual factors will fully determine meaning, but they are aspects of the cycle through which meaning is produced during play. Meaning in games is emergent, and play is a situated practice. Undertaking the textual analysis of a game does not necessarily involve ignoring these points. Textual analysis, like any methodology, does have limitations. The specifics of these limitations, however, will depend on the particular model of textuality employed. These issues are explored through an analysis of the horror survival game, Resident Evil 4.},

This occurs through their tangibility, their role as a representational object (situationally, imaginatively and audibly), and through enabling shared experiences.

	abstract = {The emergence of pervasive technologies has led to an increased interest in both the design and the development of pervasive games. This paper presents {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Them and Us{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}, an indoor pervasive game which uses theatrical processes to encourage social interaction within the confines of the game. The {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Them and Us{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} game play places a group of people together in a single space to interact with one another, whilst location-based technology informs us about the locative-nature (who, where and when) of the social interactions formed while in that space, in order to score points based on this interaction. {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Them and Us{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} adopts a narrative-based approach in which a script informs the way that participants play the game and the way their social behaviour, in regard to this becomes part of the game mechanism. This new genre of interactive game-based artwork intertwines the physical and virtual contexts of the players in order to create new and exciting player experiences. The design of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Them and Us{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} emphasizes the use of tracking the audience and performers as a way to encourage interaction within the game-space},

This study also presents an analysis of the differences between TV and the video game as cultural vehicles. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results indi- cate a relationship between game-playing behavior and the identification of Japanese culture. However, the relationship between video game playing and consumption was nonsignificant. This shows the power of video games in nation-building but not in nation-branding, in contrast with TV.

However, one recent study argues that gamers don't really socialize with other players but play alone. Part of the confusion over whether players socialize much and/or enjoy socializing while playing MMORPGs may be due to the lack of a conceptual framework that adequately articulates what is meant by 'social interaction in MMORPGs to understand how users experience interactions within the game. This study utilized ethnography to map out social interaction within the game World of Warcraft. It provides a broad framework of the factors affecting social interaction. The framework developed can be further verified and modified for future research.},

Our goal is to design digital game systems that offer the players greater choice in dictating the rules, pacing, and sociability of a game session--we describe this as supporting socially negotiated gameplay. We introduce five design principles of flexibility: dispensability, live tweakability, tangibility, mobility, and value. Our work demonstrates this approach with the design of an augmented game system composed of playing cards instrumented with near field communication chips and a mobile device with three digital game components: a Card Viewer, a Score Board, and a Turn Keeper. We report on initial user sessions and articulate two emerging challenges for supporting socially negotiated play: (a) solving interaction costs to enable greater flexibility and (b) managing user expectations for the automatic part of a manual-automatic system.},

In each iteration we constructed and tested game play and features using principles and ideas drawn from game development theory and usability/Participatory Design such as user interviews and expert reviews. Between iterations we made use of LARP-theory and theories of virtual environments to further develop the concept. Considerations of embodiment, concurrency in actions and rich communication emerge as central factors for the successful transfer between the two parts of the hybrid. Usability methods proved effective during game development giving a better and faster understanding of the needs of the players.

Or does online anonymity have no effect on the exhibition of antisocial behaviour? I argue that this line of thought presents an unsatisfactory dichotomy as it does not sufficiently account for individual contexts. Anonymity alone is not adequate to induce antisocial behaviour: it requires the motivation to act in that manner. I argue that the development of this motivation to exhibit antisocial behaviour involves a multifaceted perspective that consolidates the self (e.g. socio-economic backgrounds and the degree of value placed on anonymity) with the other (e.g. group norms). This is, in turn, influenced by the chosen media channel (e.g. games, forums, virtual worlds, chat-rooms), the presence of any wider motivations (political and sociological), and the degree of anonymity afforded by the media channel; these factors affect the way anonymity is perceived and utilised.},

This paper reports the results of a mixed methods study of the geography of Pok{\'e}mon GO that includes a five-country field survey of 375 Pok{\'e}mon GO players and a large scale geostatistical analysis of game elements. Focusing on the key geographic themes of places and movement, we find that the design of Pok{\'e}mon GO reinforces existing geographically-linked biases (e.g. the game advantages urban areas and neighborhoods with smaller minority populations), that Pok{\'e}mon GO may have instigated a relatively rare large-scale shift in global human mobility patterns, and that Pok{\'e}mon GO has geographically- linked safety risks, but not those typically emphasized by the media. Our results point to geographic design implications for future systems in this space such as a means through which the geographic biases present in Pok{\'e}mon GO may be counteracted.},

The guild under investigation in this paper is a self-labeled {\textquotedblleft}safe space{\textquotedblright} guild for female, LGBT, and other minority members of the gaming population. To promote the safe space environment, the guild{\textquoteright}s members actively enforce prohibitions against offensive language. A comparison is made between the participatory surveillance model employed by the members of the guild and the top-down policies and discipline enacted by the parent company, Blizzard Entertainment; this comparison demonstrates the effects of co-existing models of surveillance in the game community. Furthermore, the effects of the guild{\textquoteright}s practice of public discipline of rule breakers are analyzed as a soft form of shaming that enhances the effects of the guild{\textquoteright}s rules. Finally, by examining reactions from members of the guild, personal and community empowerment are the outcomes of participation in the system. Recommendations are made to incorporate elements of participatory surveillance into games in conjunction with unilateral surveillance typically employed by game developers.},

The particularities of the video game industry and culture can be recognized in the transnational corporations that contribute to its formation and development; in the global audience for its products; and in the complex mixing of format, style and content within games. As an exemplar of this process, the Japanese game publisher Square Enix is the focus of this case study, as it has been successful in contributing to global culture as well as to the digital games industry through its glocal methods. That achievement by a non-Western corporation is indicative of the hybridization of the digital games industry, and it is examined here as one indicator of the complexities and challenges, as well as future potentials, of global media culture.},

	address = {Cambridge},
	title = {Cheating: {Gaining} {Advantage} in {Videogames}},
	isbn = {0-262-03365-8},
	abstract = {The widely varying experiences of players of digital games challenge the notions that there is only one correct way to play a game. Some players routinely use cheat codes, consult strategy guides, or buy and sell in-game accounts, while others consider any or all of these practices off limits. Meanwhile, the game industry works to constrain certain readings or activities and promote certain ways of playing. In Cheating, Mia Consalvo investigates how players choose to play games and what happens when they can{\textquoteright}t always play the way they{\textquoteright}d like. She explores a broad range of player behavior, including cheating (alone and in groups), examines the varying ways that players and industry define cheating, describes how the game industry itself has helped systematize cheating, and studies online cheating in context in an online ethnography of Final Fantasy XI. She develops the concept of "gaming capital" as a key way to understand individuals{\textquoteright} interaction with games, information about games, the game industry, and other players. Consalvo provides a cultural history of cheating in videogames, looking at how the packaging and selling of such cheat-enablers as cheat books, GameSharks, and mod chips created a cheat industry. She investigates how players themselves define cheating and how their playing choices can be understood, with particular attention to online cheating. Finally, she examines the growth of the peripheral game industries that produce information about games rather than actual games. Digital games are spaces for play and experimentation; the way we use and think about digital games, Consalvo argues, is crucially important and reflects ethical choices in gameplay and elsewhere. Mia Consalvo is Associate Professor of Telecommunications at Ohio University.},

	abstract = {Discourse shapes the way we see the world. In game design and game studies, discourse also shapes the games we make, the games we play, and how we think about games in general. One key discursive construction in contemporary game culture is to portray some games as {\textquoteleft}real{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}authentic,{\textquoteright} rendering others as fake or lesser. In this essay we analyze the discourse of real games by focusing on four key discursive constructions that prop up notions of real games: developer pedigree, game mechanics, the celebration of depth and complexity, and the payment structure for games. Using the framework of constitutive rhetoric we argue that these appeals also construct a category of real gamers that has a substantial impact on what games are available and how we think about them.},

Main research themes are the construction of game/play space and identities. Within this context I elaborate in this paper on the usefulness of the term magic circle (Johan Huizinga). I will argue why in game research the current use of the term magic circle is problematic. We can understand the term differently when returning to the context in which Huizinga introduced the magic circle as ritual play-ground. According to him ritual is play and play is ritual. Referring back to his work Homo Ludens (1938) I will discuss the various relationships between role-play and ritual performance. I will argue that fantasy role-playing consists of collections of performances or ritual acts, in which players construct the game/play space, identities and meaning.},

	abstract = {Whilst no consensus yet exists on how the Internet of Things will be realised, a global infrastructure of networked physical objects that are readable, recognizable, locatable, addressable and controllable is undoubtedly a compelling vision. Although many implementations of the Internet of Things have presented these objects in a largely ambient sensing role, or providing some form of remote access/ control, in this paper we consider the emerging convergence between games and the Internet of Things. This can be seen in a growing number of games that use objects as physical game pieces to enhance the players{\textquoteright} interaction with virtual games. These hybrid physical/ digital objects present game designers with number of interesting challenges as they i) blur the boundaries between toys and games; ii) provide opportunities for freeform physical play outside the virtual game; and iii) create new requirements for interaction design, in that they utilise design techniques from both product design and computer interface design. Whilst in the past the manufacturing costs of such game objects would preclude their use within games from small independent games developers, the advent of low cost 3D printing and open software and hardware platforms, which are the enablers of the Internet of Things, means this is no longer the case. However, in order to maximise this opportunity game designers will need to develop new approaches to the design of their games and in this paper we highlight the design sensibilities required if they are to combine the digital and physical affordances within the design of such objects to produce good player experiences.},

	abstract = {Play, laughter and theatrical forms of activism have been recently documented by scholars interested in the politics and spatiality of resistance. This article focuses on the playful techniques of resistance deployed by street vendors and artisans in Mexico City as a result of the displacement generated by a recently implemented policy popularly called Plazas Limpias (clean plazas). Through a case study Coyoacan, a tourist-oriented neighbourhood known for its historical richness and aesthetic qualities, I show how street vendors and artisans who were removed from plazas in the area engaged in a number of playful resistance strategies which drew on the symbolic and material importance of place. I argue the street vendors and artisans deployed playful techniques of resistance for two reasons. First, play helped develop emotions that were crucial for the sustainability of the movement. Second, playful strategies of resistance were practiced because of the symbolic importance of Coyoacan as a place of creativity, play, performance, and art.},

After examining the materiality of open source development and hacking processes in the Ultimaker Original, I will argue how playfulness of 3D printing stimulates hacking the 3D printer. From a broader perspective, the playful practice of 3D printing can be seen as part of a general development towards the ludification of culture.},

In this paper, it will be seen that RFID is also a very interesting option for building augmented real-world games. In this paper, the use of RFID technology is motivated for the development of board games. Then we will put some researches done in this domain which are done already by researchers. Then some localization techniques are discussed. Afterwards, the author's idea to incorporate RFID system for developing a chess board is discussed. RFID based Chess Board is an attempt to design and build a useful sensory chessboard. It takes a look at various proximity sensors and how they can be applied to detect chess pieces. The chessboard is connected to a microcontroller allowing play in training mode and competition mode.},

It argues that game studies show drivers and hurdles typical for interdisciplines. Yet instead of establishing themselves as the broad umbrella interdiscipline of digital game research, they are becoming one narrow cultural studies multidiscipline within the growing and diversifying field of game research and education. Researchers from fields like human{\textendash}computer interaction or communication are abandoning game studies venues in favor of disciplinary ones{\textemdash}ironically thanks to game studies legitimizing game research. This article suggests that a design orientation and cross- disciplinary boundary objects such as middle range theories could help to broaden, deepen, and secure future interdisciplinary game research.},

It uses Victor Turner's distinction of liminal and liminoid to articulate how current views of the gameful world are steeped in specific, modernist conceptions of games and play. It foregrounds the contingency of the gameful world by delineating its historical precursors and enablers. Third, the chapter compares and contrasts the various contemporary rhetorics of the gameful world. In closing, it asks what those rhetorics tell us about our contemporary life, and what they elide, and how the rise of the gameful world may change play and games themselves.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

	abstract = {The Interactive Fiction (IF) genre describes text-based narrative experiences in which a person interacts with a computer simulation by typing text phrases (usually commands in the imperative mood) and reading software-generated text responses (usually statements in the second person present tense). Re-examining historical and contemporary IF illuminates the larger fields of electronic literature and game studies. Intertwined aesthetic and technical developments in IF from 1977 to the present are analyzed in terms of language (person, tense, and mood), narrative theory (Iser{\textquoteright}s gaps, the fabula / sjuzet distinction), game studies / ludology (player apprehension of rules, evaluation of strategic advancement), and filmic representation (subjective POV, time-loops). Two general methodological concepts for digital humanities analyses are developed in relation to IF: implied code, which facilitates studying the interactor{\textquoteright}s mental model of an interactive work; and frustration aesthetics, which facilitates analysis of the constraints that structure interactive experiences. IF works interpreted in extended {\textquotedblleft}close interactions{\textquotedblright} include Plotkin{\textquoteright}s Shade (1999), Barlow{\textquoteright}s Aisle (2000), Pontious{\textquoteright}s Rematch (2000), Foster and Ravipinto{\textquoteright}s Slouching Towards Bedlam (2003), and others.

This paper explores this tension by exposing the shortcomings of the culture economics perspective and its lack of understanding for the unique characteristics of the video game medium, thus subsequently proposing a deeper analysis of the medium by turning to literary theoretical perspectives on games, such as ludology and narratology. Due the lack of technological dimensions in its theoretical framework, narratology is deemed less fruitful as an analytical tool and ludology is preferred. Ludology, with Espen Aarseth's cybertext theory elucidates aspects of "interactivity", author-medium-reader power relations and the mechanical organization of textual machines, which provides perspectives on practice in the video game industry.},

	abstract = {Used habitually in educational settings, SimCity has been drawing many young people to design by highlighting popular aspects of urban planning. The 2007 version of the game mimics popular planning theories that resemble the controversial work of Richard Florida and his use of the creative class. Florida{\textquoteright}s writings are in this article interlinked with texts produced by Will Wright, creator of SimCity, as well as the game`s websites, manuals, in order to track these similarities. It is my understanding that both Florida{\textquoteright}s and Wright{\textquoteright}s work share and emphasize certain cultural values, including cities{\textquoteright} personalities. The analysis reveals how significantly the existence of happiness is linked to place in contemporary cultural setting, although Florida and Wright seem to disagree on how exactly they may relate. Furthermore, critiques of Florida also evoke criticism of the game{\textquoteright}s suppositions. Through interpreting SimCity{\textquoteright}s application in pedagogy, its educational value is tied to discussions of in-game assumptions which promote academic critical inquiry. The conclusion frames the game as a simulation or model in game and play theory and problematizes Wright{\textquoteright}s intention to build elaborate models based on assumptions, which players as potential urban planners absorb and emulate.},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {Pervasive games break the boundary between digital and physical to make use of elements in the real world as part of the game. One form of pervasive games are locative mobile games, which utilize physical movement as game control. To facilitate eyes-free interaction during play, these games benefit from exploring sound- based content. However, it is currently unclear what type of sound- based interaction is feasible to the general audience. Another consideration is which sound design strategies best support the goal of situated experiences, and how to design sound that supports game experiences drawing upon location-awareness, and intermixing virtual content with physical reality. A first generation of locative mobile games is already commercially available. The present contribution analyzes seven commercially available locative games (Ingress; Shadow Cities; Zombies, Run!; Inception the App; The Dark Knight Rises Z+; CodeRunner) and summarizes the sound design strategies employed to contextualize game content in real-world. Comparison to current themes in contextualized audio research indicates similarities but also challenges some assumptions regarding audio-heavy gameplay. The findings illustrate the need for simplicity regarding audio challenges, but generally confirm the view of audio-based gameplay as a facilitator of mobility. Sound is also centrally involved in shaping contextualized experiences, forging links between the physical and digital world, and indexing game content to context through functionality, verbal references, spatialization, and remediation. The article discusses two complementary strategies to systematically manipulate the physical-digital relationship, and to promote strongly situated experiences.},

As digital games are often played in social contexts, social phenomena and processes are an important part of game user research and supposed to have significant impact on the overall player experience. Gameplay metrics have been used as one method to measure player behavior, but have not been applied to detect social aspects of play yet. We present the conceptual- ization, application, and evaluation of three social gameplay metrics that aim at measuring social presence, cooperation, and leadership, respectively. A comparison of the metrics{\textquoteright} data with scores of self-report measures addressing the same concepts shows high positive correlations, thus indicating reli- ability of the metrics.},

	abstract = {This paper is a component of a three-year empirical study of gaming moms undertaken with the aim to modulate the conventional constructions of gamer identities and examine the contested status of gaming in everyday life. It presents samples of mothers in gaming discourse - from TV, Music-video, forums, and ads. Mothers have been largely invisible in popular gaming discourse or formulaically portrayed as unsympathetic to/ policing the gaming habits of other family members. Now, gaming companies increasingly target women and families, female gamers exceed 40 \% of players (US and Sweden), and console gaming is displacing TV-watching as the core living-room activity. The Boy-nerd-in-the-Bedroom is, at least statistically, being dispelled and complemented by the Girl-into-Gaming. Still, a tenacious nineteenth-century icon lingers: the Angel-in-the-House. Mothers today do more than bring Hot Pockets to gaming kids (South Park WoW-Episode) or serve as the implied inferior player populating taunts like "My Momma shoots better than you" (Q3A). Mothers game too. The paper uses feminist critical theory (de Lauretis) to illustrate the situation of the female gamer as oscillating between the fixed sign of "Woman" and the dynamic experiences of "women". It acknowledges and elucidates both the power and consequences of representation and personal experience in meaning-making processes, to which the growing cultural discourse and practice of gaming belong.},

	abstract = {Internet search rankings have a significant impact on consumer choices, mainly because users trust and choose higher-ranked results more than lower-ranked results. Given the apparent power of search rankings, we asked whether they could be manipulated to alter the preferences of undecided voters in democratic elections. Here we report the results of five relevant double-blind, randomized controlled experiments, using a total of 4,556 un- decided voters representing diverse demographic characteristics of the voting populations of the United States and India. The fifth experiment is especially notable in that it was conducted with eligible voters throughout India in the midst of India{\textquoteright}s 2014 Lok Sabha elections just before the final votes were cast. The results of these experiments demonstrate that (i) biased search rankings can shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20\% or more, (ii) the shift can be much higher in some demographic groups, and (iii) search ranking bias can be masked so that people show no awareness of the manipulation. We call this type of influence, which might be applicable to a variety of attitudes and beliefs, the search engine manipulation effect. Given that many elections are won by small margins, our results suggest that a search engine company has the power to influence the results of a substantial number of elections with impunity. The impact of such manipula- tions would be especially large in countries dominated by a single search engine company.},

The model includes three components: sensory, challenge-based and imaginative immersion (SCI-model). The classification was assessed with self-evaluation questionnaires filled in by informants who played different popular games. It was found that the gameplay experiences related to these games did indeed differ as expected in terms of the identified three immersion components.},

Yet, rarely do meta-analyses succeed at resolving ideological debates. Multiple decision points related to the selection, coding, effect size extraction, and interpretation of studies leaves considerable room for meta-analytic authors to interject their own beliefs. Meta-analyses are typically hailed by those who agreed a priori with their conclusion, and rejected as fatally flawed by those in disagreement.

Scholars also have debated the potential for violent games to have positive effects such as on visuospatial cognition or math ability. The current study sought to extend previous literature by using well-validated clinical outcome measures for relevant constructs, which have generally been lacking in past research. Cross-section data on aggression, visuospatial cognition, and math achievement were available for a sample of 333 (51.7 \% female) mostly Hispanic youth (mean age = 12.76). Prospective 1-year data on aggression and school GPA were available for 143 (46.2 \% female) of those youth. Results from both sets of analysis revealed that exposure to violent game had neither short-term nor long-term predictive influences on either positive or negative outcomes. A developmental analysis of the cross-sectional data revealed that results did not differ across age categories of older children, preadolescents or adolescents. Analysis of effect sizes largely ruled out Type II error as a possible explanation for null results. Suggestions for new directions in the field of video game research are proffered.},

	abstract = {In the problematic exploration of the narrative potential of videogames, one of the clearest aspects that bridge stories and games is space. This paper examines the different devices that videogames have used to incorporate stories through spatial design and what is known as environmental storytelling, focusing on the design elements that make the story directly relevant to gameplay beyond world-building and backstory exposition. These design-related elements are accounted for with the term indexical storytelling. As a refinement of the concept of environmental storytelling, indexical storytelling is a productive game design device, since reading the space of the game and learning about the events that have taken place in it are required to traverse the game successfully. Storytelling becomes a game of story-building, since the player has to piece together the story, or construct a story of her own interaction in the world by leaving a trace.},

This is not the case, however, with videogames. In recent years, a number of self-reflexive games have appeared, exemplified by Davey Wreden{\textquoteright}s The Stanley Parable (2013), an ironic game about games. When self-awareness migrates form print to screen, however, something happens. If metafiction can be characterized by how it draws attention to its materiality{\textemdash}the artificiality of language and the construction involved in acts of representation{\textemdash}The Stanley Parable draws attention to the digital, procedural materiality of videogames. Following the work of Alexander R. Galloway and Ian Bogost, I argue that the self-reflexivity of The Stanley Parable is best understood in terms of action and procedure, as metaproceduralism. This essay explores the legacies of United States metafiction in videogames, suggesting that though postmodernism might be over, its lessons are important to remember for confronting the complex digital realities of the twenty-first century. If irony may be ebbing in fiction, it has found a vital and necessary home in videogames and we underestimate its power to challenge the informatic, algorithmic logic of cultural production in the digital age to our detriment.},

	abstract = {When a pregnant woman makes a decision or acts in a manner that may be detrimental to the health and well-being of her fetus, her physician may be faced with an ethical dilemma. Is the physician's primary duty to respect the woman's autonomy, or to promote behaviour that may be in the best interest of the fetus? The controversial concept of "fetal rights" or the "fetus as a patient" contributes to the notion that the pregnant woman and her fetus are potential adversaries. However, Canadian law has upheld women's right to life, liberty and security of the person and has not recognized fetal rights. If a woman is competent and refuses medical advice, her decision must be respected even if the physician believes that her fetus will suffer as a result. Coercion of the woman is not permissible no matter what appears to be in the best interest of the fetus.},

This sparks deep analysis of how values are expressed through particular game mechanics and representational elements. The analysis can be posted to a collective wiki and shared amongst other designers who are interested in examining game mechanics and representational elements from a values perspective. These exercises can be considered first steps in a broader attempt to produce and implement a systematic methodology to better integrate human principles into the design process.},

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies.},

Most scholars have interpreted this as a sign of dissatisfaction with particular governments rather than with the political system as a whole.

Across a wide sample of countries in North America and Western Europe, citizens of mature democracies have become markedly less satisfied with their form of government and surprisingly open to nondemocratic alternatives. A serious democratic disconnect has emerged. If it widens even further, it may begin to challenge the stability of seemingly consolidated democracies.},

New materialism de-privileges human agency, focusing instead upon how assemblages of the animate and inanimate together produce the world, with fundamental implications for social inquiry methodology and methods. Key to our exploration is the materialist notion of a {\textquoteleft}research-assemblage{\textquoteright} comprising researcher, data, methods and contexts. We use this understanding first to explore the micropolitics of the research process, and then {\textendash} along with a review of 30 recent empirical studies {\textendash} to establish a framework for materialist social inquiry methodology and methods. We discuss the epistemological consequences of adopting a materialist ontology.},

It describes the permeation of economic, political, and social contexts by game-elements such as awards, rule structures, and interfaces that are inspired by video games. Sometimes the term is reduced to the implementation of points, badges, and leaderboards as incentives and motivations to be productive. Sometimes it is envisioned as a universal remedy to deeply transform society toward more humane and playful ends. Despite its use by corporations to manage brand communities and personnel, however, gamification is more than just a marketing buzzword. States are beginning to use it as a new tool for governing populations more effectively. It promises to fix what is wrong with reality by making every single one of us fitter, happier, and healthier. Indeed, it seems like all of society is up for being transformed into one massive game. The contributions in this book offer a candid assessment of the gamification hype. They trace back the historical roots of the phenomenon and explore novel design practices and methods. They critically discuss its social implications and even present artistic tactics for resistance. It is time to rethink gamification!},

	abstract = {Our focus lies on moral emotions in the social virtual world Second Life (SL). Based on media equation theory we could expect that moral emotions regulate social virtual interactions in a similar way as they do in real life (RL). However, emotions are also linked with involvement, and SL residents presumably are more involved in SL compared to non-residents. Via two quasi-experiments, we tested to what extent moral emotions felt when being cheated on by a love partner are comparable in intensity when this happens in SL versus RL. Results show that for SL residents the intensity of moral emotions did not differ between SL versus RL situations, whereas for non-residents a SL situation triggered less intense emotions. Further, for SL residents the level of involvement in SL had a significant impact on the moral emotions in response to a SL situation. In social virtual worlds, media equation thus seems to depend on involvement.},

	abstract = {What attracted so many supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement to the movement{\textquoteright}s Facebook pages? Using a database of 1500 Facebook Occupy group pages, we analyze the types of posts that recruit new users. In the case of the Occupy movement, the success of recruiting over 400,000 users to Facebook was driven by user-created content produced in a medium that encourages contributions and sharing to an existing set of dense networks of potential movement sympathizers. We find that the posts that are most successful at recruiting active Facebook engagement utilize existing forms of communication, such as sharing pictures and status updates. We also find that posts that use confrontational messages and messages about solidarity appear most often in the top posts. Our findings suggest that online social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter provide a powerful tool for movements to rapidly spread information and reach broad audiences. In addition, we offer some analysis of the impact of these findings for social movements that hope to utilize Facebook.},

This article examines a new version of Monopoly, titled Local Property Trader that works with NFC/QR code technologies in order to encourage players to move around the city and interact with local businesses. In doing so, the project hopes to highlight how location-based games can use social media data to update a traditional game into more contemporary contexts. Correspondingly, the differences and similarities of taking a boardgame and reworking it for the city streets are explored through ideas surrounding location, player and map as key points of intersection between the two media forms.},

The central claim of this essay is that the DWSN is an experiment in power/freedom, an attempt to simultaneously trace, deploy, and overcome the historical conditions in which it finds itself: the generic constraints and affordances of social networking as they have been developed over the past decade by Facebook and Twitter, and the ideological constraints and affordances of public perceptions of the dark web, which hold that the dark web is useful for both taboo activities and freedom from state oppression. I trace the DWSN{\textquoteright}s experiment with power/freedom through three practices: anonymous/social networking, the banning of child pornography, and the productive aspects of techno-elitism. I then use these practices to specify particular forms of power/freedom on the DWSN.},

In three experiments, we investigated the psychological status of these metaphors by asking subjects to carry out temporal inferences stated in terms of spatial metaphors. In Experiment 1, we found that subjects were slowed in their processing when the assertions shifted from one spatial metaphoric system to the other. In Experiment 2, we determined that this cost of shifting could not be attributed to local lexical factors. In Experiment 3, we again found this metaphor consistency effect in a naturalistic version of the study in which we asked commonsense time questions of passengers at an airport. The results of the three studies provide converging evidence that people use spatial metaphors in temporal reasoning. Implications for the status of metaphoric systems are discussed.},

To address this, a typology of what we call super-participation (super-posters, agenda-setters and facilitators) is developed and applied to the http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/ forum. Focusing on the first of these, we found 2,052 superposters (0.4\%) contributing 47\% of 25m+ posts. While superposters were quantitatively dominant, qualitative content analysis of the discursive practices of 25 superposters (n=40,044) found that most did not attempt to stop other users from posting (curbing) or attack them (flaming). In fact, in contradiction to the received wisdom, super-posters discursively performed a range of positive roles.},

	title = {The {Benefits} of {Playing} {Video} {Games}},
	abstract = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children{\textquoteright}s and adolescents{\textquoteright} lives, with 97\% playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of {\textquotedblleft}gaming{\textquotedblright} has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is impor- tant, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming in- creasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and so- cial. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a the- oretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.},

Described as "the online water-cooler," his show has become a talking point for many on social media. In this study, we tested the effects of such political comedy and the influence of social pressure in a simulated Facebook environment (N = 189). Participants in this experiment were asked to view a video clip from Oliver's show (high or low salience topic) and in two of the four conditions, a series of Facebook comments contradicting Oliver's views (as a form of social pressure) were provided. Results support a message-consistent persuasive effect of political comedy for both high and low salience issues but finds that message-incongruent commentary reduces this persuasive effect. Thus, the current study provides further insight regarding persuasive effects of sharing political information on social media and new opportunities for exposing entertainment seekers to politics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite hundreds of studies, there is continuing debate about the extent to which violent video games increase aggression. Believers argue that playing violent video games increases aggression, but this stance is disputed by skeptics. The present study addressed believers' and skeptics' responses to summaries of scientific studies that do or do not present evidence for increased aggression after violent video game play.

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Participants (N?=?662) indicated whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Afterwards, they evaluated two opposing summaries of fictitious studies on the effects of violent video play. They also reported whether their initial belief had changed after reading the two summaries and indicated again whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Results showed that believers evaluated the study showing an effect more favorably than a study showing no effect, whereas the opposite was observed for skeptics. Moreover, both believers and skeptics reported to become more convinced of their initial view. In contrast, for actual attitude change, a depolarization effect was found.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that biased assimilation of new information leads believers and skeptics to become more rather than less certain of their views. Hence, even when confronted with mixed and inconclusive evidence, the perceived gap between both sides of the argument increases.},

The present research provides a meta-analytical test of the idea that depending on their content, video games do affect social outcomes. Data from 98 independent studies with 36,965 participants revealed that for both violent video games and prosocial video games, there was a significant association with social outcomes. Whereas violent video games increase aggression and aggression-related variables and decrease prosocial outcomes, prosocial video games have the opposite effects. These effects were reliable across experimental, correlational, and longitudinal studies, indicating that video game exposure causally affects social outcomes and that there are both short- and long-term effects.},

This article does not articulate whether or not the virtual worlds of video games, digital simulations, and virtual technologies currently actualize (or will actualize) Nozick{\textquoteright}s thought experiment. Instead, it proposes a philosophical reflection that focuses on human experiences in the upcoming age of their {\textquoteleft}technical reproducibility{\textquoteright}. In pursuing that objective, this article integrates and supplements some of the interrogatives proposed in Robert Nozick{\textquoteright}s thought experiment. More specifically, through the lenses of existentialism and philosophy of technology, this article tackles the technical and cultural heritage of virtual reality, and unpacks its potential to function as a tool for self-discovery and self-construction. Ultimately, it provides an interpretation of virtual technologies as novel existential domains. Virtual worlds will not be understood as the contexts where human beings can find completion and satisfaction, but rather as instruments that enable us to embrace ourselves and negotiate with various aspects of our (individual as well as collective) existence in previously-unexperienced guises.},

In this paper, we present a game proto- type that enables children travelling in the back seat of a car to enjoy a narrated experience where gameplay combines with the experience of trav- eling through the road network. The prototype is designed to provide what we refer to as a believ- able environment. We propose four design char- acteristics to persuasively include a journey within a pervasive game. First, the story should refer to geographical objects with their everyday meanings. Second, the game{\textquoteright}s scale needs to cover vast areas. Third, the application should provide sequential storytelling to make it fit with the journey experience, and finally it should pro- vide interaction support where players can en- gage in gameplay and interact with the computer in various ways at the same time as they are looking out of the car window. We describe how these requirements have been implemented in the prototype and present an initial performance test.},

They use many differ- ent types of media to deliver an interactive narrative to the players and include puzzles that are part of a bigger quest that the players are trying to solve. They are not widely used in education and there is limited amount of research done considering their benefits to learning. However, espe- cially some commercial entertainment ARGs have managed to engage people in collaborative problem solving very well. Therefore, benefits and issues of using ARGs in education, and especially in computer science education (CSE), are dis- cussed in this paper. Alternate reality games could poten- tially be used to teach various computer science concepts, to enable student networking, and to promote computer science programs. A case study was conducted in order to research the potential of using alternate reality games in computer science education. The research of the case study is still in progress, but the preliminary results are promising.

	abstract = {The main objective of this thesis is to enrich computer science education by studying two gameful teaching interventions: 1) achievement badges and 2) alternate reality games. Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, and achievement badges are one commonly used gamification method that can be used to provide optional challenges for students. We studied the use of achievement badges in a Data Structures and Algorithms course and found out that badges can be used to steer students' behavior even if they are not tied to tangible rewards such as course grades. Specifically, students used more time in the online learning environment, had more sessions in the system, and spent more time between exercise submissions when the badges were used. Furthermore, we found out that students' attitudes towards the badges varied. We also studied the use of badges in relation to achievement goal orientations that characterize students' preferences to different goals and outcomes. We found out that students who had high avoidance orientation were less motivated by the badges than other students. On the other hand, students who were the most motivated by the badges had higher mastery-intrinsic, mastery-extrinsic, and performance-approach orientations, and lower avoidance orientation. Furthermore, we compared the badge intervention with the use of heatmaps that provided feedback on one's behavior in a non- gameful way. An interest towards the badges correlated with mastery-extrinsic and performance-approach, whereas interest towards the heatmaps correlated with mastery- extrinsic and performance-avoidance orientations. Alternate Reality Games (ARG), are games that blur the line between reality and fiction and typically they involve puzzles and an interactive narrative. We explored the use of ARGs for teaching computer science by organizing an ARG covering a wide range of computer science concepts. In the feedback collected after the game, participants reported learning several computer science concepts during the game. We also evaluated how authenticity, intrinsic motivation, and replayability were taken into account in the game design. Furthermore, we present an example of an educational ARG that was not part of any official curriculum and relied on voluntary participation. Based on the results, alternate reality games seem like a promising approach to be used in computer science education. In addition to evaluating the two approaches, we provide support for applying them in education by describing the implementation of our badge systems and introducing a method for producing automatically assessed programming tasks that are suitable for ARGs.},

	abstract = {While the last decade has seen massive improvements in not only the rendering quality, but also the overall performance of console and desktop video games, these improvements have not necessarily led to a greater population of video game players. In addition to continuing these improvements, the video game industry is also constantly searching for new ways to convert non-players into dedicated gamers. Despite the growing popularity of computer-based video games, people still love to play traditional board games, such as Risk, Monopoly, and Trivial Pursuit. Both video and board games have their strengths and weaknesses, and an intriguing conclusion is to merge both worlds. We believe that a tabletop form-factor provides an ideal interface for digital board games. The design and implementation of tabletop games will be influenced by the hardware platforms, form factors, sensing technologies, as well as input techniques and devices that are available and chosen. This chapter is divided into three major sections. In the first section, we describe the most recent tabletop hardware technologies that have been used by tabletop researchers and practitioners. In the second section, we discuss a set of experimental tabletop games. The third section presents ten evaluation heuristics for tabletop game design.

	abstract = {This paper reviews the current body of empirical research on persuasive technologies (95 studies). In recent years, technology has been increasingly harnessed to persuade and motivate people to engage in various behaviors. This phenomenon has also attracted substantial scholarly interest over the last decade. This review examines the results, methods, measured behavioral and psychological outcomes, affordances in implemented persuasive systems, and domains of the studies in the current body of research on persuasive technologies. The reviewed studies have investigated diverse persuasive systems/designs, psychological factors, and behavioral outcomes. The results of the reviewed studies were categorized into fully positive, partially positive, and negative and/or no effects. This review provides an overview of the state of empirical research regarding persuasive technologies. The paper functions as a reference in positioning future research within the research stream of persuasive technologies in terms of the domain, the persuasive stimuli and the psychological and behavioral outcomes.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews peer-reviewed empirical studies on gamification. We create a framework for examining the effects of gamification by drawing from the definitions of gamification and the discussion on motivational affordances. The literature review covers results, independent variables (examined motivational affordances), dependent variables (examined psychological/behavioral outcomes from gamification), the contexts of gamification, and types of studies performed on the gamified systems. The paper examines the state of current research on the topic and points out gaps in existing literature. The review indicates that gamification provides positive effects, however, the effects are greatly dependent on the context in which the gamification is being implemented, as well as on the users using it. The findings of the review provide insight for further studies as well as for the design of gamified systems.},

By doing so, it shows that larping exists in areas which are not larp, and that there is a need to start differentiating between {\textquoteleft}larping{\textquoteright}, the act of physically playing a character, and {\textquoteleft}larp{\textquoteright}, one of the best-known framings in which larping takes place. The role-playing parts of historical re-enactment, sadomasochism, bibliodrama and even post-modern magic are all examples of larping that is not normally seen as such, just similar to it. In all of them, people physically play fictional personas within fictional or temporarily altered realities. They do this in a manner identical to the larping done in larps. The activity context of each, however, is very different from larps. By examining such forms of larping, it is possible to understand much more of the activity itself, as well as the significance of the larping part to the various fields where it is practiced.},

Activists produced the draft text of the law on digital collaboration platforms, and support for the law was petitioned using strong digital identification. This article analyzes how the campaign for the Equal Marriage Law used new digital tools and created practices that affect democratic citizenship and power making. The campaigners succeeded in introducing to the national political debate the idea of a bill that had been twice rejected in the political process. This article introduces the typology of the mediating citizen to describe civic action that is able to affect representative politics in a constructive way and reprogram power. The radical legal framework, the Citizens{\textquoteright} Initiative Act, offered a channel to pursue meaningful civic agency in Finland and counter the legitimacy crisis of representative democracies. In future efforts for enhancing digital civic participation such a channel for real impact should be part of the design.},

Moreover, we argue that some of these methods are in fact vices, which are damaging to the character of the developer, and should therefore be avoided.},

	abstract = {Artikkeli k{\"a}sittelee nykyajan nukkeleikkien pelillistymist{\"a} luovan ja tuotteliaan, massatuotetuilla nukeilla tapahtuvan leikin ja siit{\"a} ker{\"a}tyn ja tuotetun leikkitiedon n{\"a}k{\"o}kulmasta. Pelillistymisen (gamification) k{\"a}site on perinteisesti liitetty pelillisten funktioiden integroimiseen laitteissa, jotka eiv{\"a}t p{\"a}{\"a}asiallisesti ole suun- niteltuja pelik{\"a}ytt{\"o}{\"o}n. Kulttuurin leikillistymisen (ludification) ohessa voidaan puhua my{\"o}s leikkiv{\"a}linei- den pelillistymisest{\"a}: lelukulttuurin artefakteissa pelillistyminen n{\"a}kyy hybridisyyten{\"a} erilaisten alustojen v{\"a}limaastoihin sijoittuvissa materiaalisissa ja digitaalisissa leikkiv{\"a}lineiss{\"a} ja n{\"a}iden yhteensulautumissa. Paitsi erilaisissa tuotteissa ja sovelluksissa, pelillistyminen voidaan todeta my{\"o}s nykyajan hahmoleluihin liittyv{\"a}ss{\"a} leikkitoiminnassa - leikkiv{\"a}lineiden k{\"a}ytt{\"o}tavoissa. T{\"a}ss{\"a} artikkelissa kysyn, miten pelillisty- minen mahdollistuu ja esitt{\"a}ytyy nukkeihin liittyv{\"a}ss{\"a} leikkitoiminnassa; luovassa ja sosiaalisesti jaetussa leikiss{\"a}, jonka k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}j{\"a} selvit{\"a}n sek{\"a} Gibsonin esitt{\"a}m{\"a}n ja Normanin kehitt{\"a}m{\"a}n affordanssiteorian avulla ett{\"a} nykyp{\"a}iv{\"a}n leikkitiedon k{\"a}sitteen puitteissa.

	abstract = {Contemporary play(fulness) manifests itself as multimedial cultures of production, distribution, consumption and use. In the core of the ecosystem of contemporary play are the play industries, the play products, the creative and productive players and technologies, which all play important roles in shaping ludic behavior. Today, a significant part of play practices are in one way or another connected with different screens: technology together with social media platforms enables players to share their play in online environments in ways that were unimaginable in times when toy and game enthusiasts communicated mostly through hobbyist conventions, newsletters and fanzines. Through various screens, players carry out different play patterns related to e.g. photoplay or videography made of toys and games. Player created content influences the industries of play by directing companies to build marketing strategies and actual products that in one way or another capture and capitalize on the essential elements that have made social media popular {\textendash} its capability to engage users in circulating visual, audio-based and animated play content. Developers and designers of various play experiences (material, digital or their combinations {\textendash} hybrids/phygitals) operate with concepts such playability and play value in order to give form to products and applications that are able to invite their users to meaningful ludic activities. One of the elements that build play value is the social aspect of play experiences. At the same time, there is a lack of conceptual tools for measuring social play value for products that are simultaneously situated, used and experienced in physical, digital (and in-between) environments and as a part of either/both material artefacts and digitally enhanced or augmented play worlds. The first step in this direction is to map out the strategies of social screen players across the ecosystem of play. In order to understand the constituents of social play value, this review aims to investigate the ways in which social screen play operates across the networked ecosystem of contemporary play. By reviewing practices of the play industry and comparing them with current play patterns shared on social media, the author builds a foundation for understanding the building blocks of the ecosystem of contemporary play and the various strategies its actors are presenting in terms of screen-based play patterns. Through a small-scale analysis conducted on the screen-based media of Flickr, YouTube and Kickstarter with search words game(s), toy(s) and hybrid social play applied in each, the author then cross-examines how what is considered valuable in terms of play products parallel each other between the actors of the ecosystem of contemporary play: the current makers, users and potential future players involved in the ecosystem.},

We use logs from the participants in Quinn{\textquoteright}s harassment to deconstruct the anatomy, techniques and methodology of misogynist online harassment, and how it is permitted and normalized by wider gaming culture. We stress that while this is not universal, it is wide-spread, insidious, and a major problem for video gaming culture.

	url = {http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-39-6612-6},
	abstract = {This dissertation focuses on the social philosophy of humor from the viewpoint of Erich Fromm{\textquoteright}s critical humanistic thinking. The work consists of an introduction and four individual articles. The introduction discusses Fromm{\textquoteright}s theories in relation to the phenomenon of humor to provide a basis for the articles. The central aim is to understand the dynamic nature of humor and how it is related to the problem of being a paradoxical creature, that is, a human being. It is claimed that humor has to be analyzed and interpreted in a unique historical and cultural situation. The first article discusses Fromm{\textquoteright}s concept of social character to offer a theoretical tool to understand how deeply humor is a social phenomenon. It is argued that the social character is a crucial component if we are to reach beyond jokes and laughter, and to grasp their deeper social significance. The second article furthers this thought by developing a critical standpoint on the phenomenon of laughing at oneself. It calls into question the prevailing optimism about the capability to ridicule oneself. Following Fromm, it is claimed that humor needs a serious backbone from which the perceived oddities are evaluated. The third article brings forth the debate of humor and freedom. In opposition to the widely shared idea that humor should be absolutely free, it is argued that humor cannot be separated from the sphere of humanity, and this basic fact sets the ground for the freedom of humor. Freedom has to be obtained within the limits of humanity. This leads to the notion that it is untenable to claim that we should be always able to laugh at everything.? The fourth article elaborates the influence of social circumstances for humor, and the competitive nature of contemporary humor is taken under critical scrutiny. It is argued that humor and laughter reflect the current historical situation and, eventually, ourselves. Therefore, from a humanistic perspective, it is concerning how natural and popular humor competitions appear to be.?As a whole, the dissertation is a philosophical study, and it aims more at philosophical understanding than to concrete empirical research settings. However, the conducted research is empirically inspired philosophy, and thus intimately connected to the living phenomena of humor and laughter.},

A small but growing number of scholars are starting to view griefing as an avant-garde, anarchist, or hacktivist political activity. I suggest that Ranci{\`e}re offers a more specific articulation of what constitutes political action and activism for griefing collectives because his understanding of politics is entirely grounded in relationship to the types of communities and individual political equality. The article focuses specifically on the Patriotic Nigras activities in the Great Habbo Raid of 2006 in an attempt to understand how a Ranci{\`e}reian[eian or ian?] framework can provide some analytical tools for articulating politics in virtual worlds. I conclude that the PN do not ultimately realise a Rancierian[two different spellings] framework. They challenge not partitions of the sensible, but partitions of the nonsensical specific to the different operation of politics and community formation in virtual worlds. http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-160-politics-is-serious-business-jacques-ranciere-griefing-and-the-re-partitioning-of-the-nonsensical/},

The present article discusses the applicability of the notions of meta-game and meta-gaming in understanding the patterns of how people use, misuse, work and work-around information and information infrastructures. Method. Twenty-two qualitative interviews of archives, library and museum professionals conducted in two Nordic countries in 2009-2011. The interviews were semi-structured and based on the thematic interview approach of Hirsj{\"a}rvi and Hurme as a part of a larger study of the information work of such professionals. Analysis. An exploratory qualitative analysis based on constant comparative method was carried out on the interview data. Results. The analysis shows that the information work of the interviewed professionals contained a large number of examples of different types of meta-gaming. Conclusions. The analysis suggests that the notions of meta-games and meta-gaming can be used to explain peripheral and second-order information activities and to analyse the aspects of work that relate to gameplay and playfulness.},

Role- playing language is different from everyday language, because the worlds created in role-play are not just a reflection or extension of everyday life. We examine three examples of interaction in live action role- playing games. In all three, players rely on shared cultural knowledge. In the first example, two players employ the cultural conventions about the meanings of colors, objects and space as well as materials borrowed from myth and folklore in order to enact an encounter between a mage and a dragon. In the second, the organizers enact scenes from literary classics in order to construct the game plot. In the third, the players employ cultural stereotypes of personalities and behavior in order to present characters of diverse age and social status. Angelina},

Ludologic attributes of games have been preferred more than narrative ones. However, results of studies attempted to reveal importance of narrative structures and storytelling for computer games, especially for educational ones. In the present study, narratology including storytelling and narrative structures will be discussed in terms of narratology-based educational computer game de- sign. 46 non-player preservice teachers at Department of Foreign Language Education participated to the study. Participants, as subject matter experts on teaching English Language, designed educational game prototypes. Those pro- totypes were analyzed and reported according to their narrative aspects.},

	abstract = {As texts which are based on collaborative and interactive narration, tabletop {\textendash} also known as {\textquotedblleft}pen and paper{\textquotedblright} {\textendash} role-playing games (TRPGs) are distinct in their technological simplicity. Indeed, in their traditional form all they require is the physical presence of a group of players {\textendash} commonly around a table, hence {\textquotedblleft}tabletop{\textquotedblright} {\textendash} who collaboratively participate in developing a narrative; and a system of rules which allow resolving the outcome of situations in which different levels of chance may be involved {\textendash} the need to write down statistic information making them {\textquotedblleft}pen and paper{\textquotedblright}. Evidently, this apparent lack of sophistication makes role-playing games {\textendash} as a clearly contemporary cultural phenomenon (cf. Punday, 2005; Nephew, 2004; Harrigan, 2007; Mackay, 2001) {\textendash} stand out in the context of a world that is becoming ever more dependent on technology. All the more so, considering the persistence of TRPGs in the face of its {\textquotedblleft}descendants{\textquotedblright} in other more technologically advanced media and despite what has become the popular notion of {\textquotedblleft}the bigger, the faster, the better.{\textquotedblright} Nevertheless, that which occurs during a role-playing game session {\textendash} the level of interactivity, player immersion in the narrative, flexibility of the rules, etc. - generally surpasses, even today, what many of its {\textquotedblleft}successors{\textquotedblright} achieve. How does this occur? How is it possible; through what mechanisms do TRPGs allow such sophistication when relying solely on the {\textquotedblleft}old fashioned{\textquotedblright} technologies of (hand-) writing and oral narration? Approaching these questions from the general perspective of literary studies, the following paper problematizes what can be called a {\textquotedblleft}na{\"i}ve view{\textquotedblright} of communication technology by addressing the complex relationship between the printed texts used for role-playing {\textendash} such as rule- and sourcebooks {\textendash} and the narratives created during game-play. To do so, it addresses the fundamental influence that framings, such as rules, character sheets and setting, as well as paratextual elements contained within or at the borders of these texts, such as cover illustrations, prologues and epilogues, just to name a few {\textendash} have on participants{\textquoteright} interpretation and, most importantly, creation of TRPG narratives.

This paper examines the 2007 computer game Bioshock in relation to its thematic employment of the ideals of market libertarianism as depicted in the novels of Ayn Rand and its strategic use and withholding of agency at critical moments in the gameplay. It argues that Bioshock not only uses the techniques of traditional narrative forms to address the culturally significant issue of the impossible alliance between traditionalism and libertarianism under a conservative banner but also uses the interactive medium to generate a genuinely new aesthetic experience in which the logic of free choice in the narrative, ideology, and medium are simultaneously brought into juxtaposition. This moment marks a landmark development in digital narrative and opens new possibilities for the art form.},

	url = {http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-39-6273-9},
	abstract = {The present study focuses on the conditions required for ensuring objectivity in those fields of scientific research that are expected to produce socially relevant outcomes. It is comprised of four individual articles and an introductory chapter. The introductory chapter begins with a discussion on the concept of {\textquoteleft}objectivity{\textquoteright}. A short introduction to the history of the concept is given, the complexity of its current use is explained, and the connection between the objectivity of research and public trust in science is indicated. Next, the theoretical background of the dissertation is articulated: 1) criticism of individualistic views on objectivity of science, 2) criticism of value-freedom of science, and 3) acknowledgement of the importance of the context of scientific inquiry. The introductory chapter ends with an overview of the individual articles and a discussion on the implications of this study. The first article examines the conditions for objectivity in the context of commercialized research. A traditional, individualistic conception of the objectivity of science is criticized, and it is argued that certain features of commercialized research culture are epistemically harmful. The second article focuses on Helen Longino{\textquoteright}s (1990; 2002) theory on the objectivity of science. The focus is on the criteria Longino offers as tools for evaluating research communities. By introducing two cases in biomedical sciences, it is argued that her theory can be complemented by taking notice of extra-scientific factors. In the third article, different ideals of objectivity are discussed in the context of medical research and conducting meta-analyses in particular. With criticism of an article by Stegenga (2011), the article demonstrates that the so-called procedural ideal of objectivity does not manage to capture some of the most central features of medical knowledge production. A case of research on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is introduced, and it is argued that adopting the so-called social view on objectivity can help us to better evaluate medical science. The fourth article examines journal peer review and the effects of different individual-level biases from a social-epistemological perspective. It is argued that the institutional context of peer review can have a significant effect on how biases influence the pool of published literature.},

Using a comparative analysis, the author shows that the two games' have different approaches to using characters as narrative tools within the same genre, while also incorporating these narrative features tightly into gameplay. Central to the argument is the idea that presenting the player as protagonist is not necessarily the most fruitful approach to narrative experiences in games, and that narrative coherence may be better established and maintained through letting non-player characters carry the weight of narrative progression.},

The difference is refined into a challenge-based theory for understanding the videogame and its peculiar rhetorical character. The premise is that videogame play, gaming, is either a kinesthetic or nonkinesthetic activity depending on the effort required to overcome the gaming challenge. A gaming challenge is kinesthetic if overcoming it requires nontrivial psychomotor effort, and it is nonkinesthetic if the nontrivial effort required to overcome it is cognitive alone. While kinesthetic and nonkinesthetic challenges define the modes of gaming, they are also the languages through which videogame rhetorics operate. As an alternative to the previously established meaning-centered approaches to videogame rhetoric, this article proposes a view that conceives of gaming as autotelic persuasive performance; as a rhetoric with no claims, arguments, or extractable thematic meaning. This {\textquoteleft}nonhermeneutic{\textquoteright} rhetoric is termed aporetic rhematic.},

Comparison. The article compares the simulation of videogame research to the ways in which other scientific sectors utilize the term. Problematic science communication. It turns out that videogame research has found an eccentric use for simulation with none or little relation to the term{\textquoteright}s scientific (knowledge-driven) and etymological (imitational) predecessors. This becomes a problem in cross-scientific communication. Intentional philosophy. In order to overcome the problem, the article encourages scholars to adopt an intentional philosophy of simulation according to which videogames and their components may be structured as computerized simulators or simulations if functional evidence for a reference system exists. For those cases that lack functional evidence, the article (re)proposes the conceptual framework of virtuality.},

Additionally, analog feelies are suggested to possess a tactile aspect that has the potential to enhance their immersive impact at both effective levels.

	abstract = {Pok{\'e}mon GO, an augmented reality mobile game, captured the attention of millions of people around the world in July 2016. Various sources from around the globe have reported both positive and negative incidents and outcomes related to the game. Some of the incidents have been particularly remarkable for the player, i.e., critical incidents. A critical incident is a single experience, which a person perceives or remembers as unusually positive or negative. Critical incidents typically are highly influential for human behavior, and thus, important to study. Playing augmented reality games can take place in varying situational contexts. Situational context includes information that can be used to characterize the situation of a person, place, or object, and has been shown to be influential in mobile use context. This study investigates in which kinds of situational contexts do critical incidents of augmented reality game Pok{\'e}mon GO take place. The focus is on four different situational contexts that Pok{\'e}mon GO can be played in: sociality, interaction state, place, and reasons for playing. The study is based on analysing an online survey sample of 226 responses. The findings pose insights and implications regarding augmented reality applications and games in general, and thus, assist the developers in their efforts to provide the users with meaningful and positive experiences with games and other augmented reality applications.},

Play mood is a state of being in which we are open and ready, both to others and their production of meaning and to new opportunities for producing meaning. This play mood is created when we engage with the world during play practices. The article points out four types of play moods {\textendash} devotion, intensity, tension and euphorica {\textendash} which show an affiliation with four types of play practices such as sliding, shifting, displaying and exceeding. Though play practices and play moods become possible, this conceptual framework makes it possible to highlight three features of play {\textendash} first, moods are essential to play; second, moods are always in plural and finally, different moods describe different ways of being in play which means different ways of engaging with the world and the people around us.},

To exemplify the elaborated methodology, the authors apply it to the rhythm game DJ HERO.

Thus, playing research needs to go beyond the limits of gameworld and normative gameplay, and move toward a concept or assemblage of play that takes into account games as singular and multifaceted technocultural entities.},

	volume = {10},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0131613},
	abstract = {Gender inequality and sexist behaviour is prevalent in almost all workplaces and rampant in online environments. Although there is much research dedicated to understanding sexist behaviour, we have almost no insight into what triggers this behaviour and the individuals that initiate it. Although social constructionist theory argues that sexism is a response towards women entering a male dominated arena, this perspective doesn't explain why only a subset of males behave in this way. We argue that a clearer understanding of sexist behaviour can be gained through an evolutionary perspective that considers evolved differences in intra-sexual competition. We hypothesised that female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status. To test this hypothesis, we used an online first-person shooter video game that removes signals of dominance but provides information on gender, individual performance, and skill. We show that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly. In contrast, lower-skilled players behaved submissively towards a male-voiced player in the identical scenario. This difference in gender-directed behaviour became more extreme with poorer focal-player performance. We suggest that low-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status as a consequence of hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena. Higher-skilled players, in contrast, were more positive towards a female relative to a male teammate. As higher-skilled players have less to fear from hierarchical reorganization, we argue that these males behave more positively in an attempt to support and garner a female player's attention. Our results provide the clearest picture of inter-sexual competition to date, highlighting the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the factors that affect male hostility towards women.},

	abstract = {The internet has allowed for a vast array of relational and expressional opportunities and risks, becoming an especially central component in the lives of young people in nations leading in consumer technology. Notably, most forms of internet use involve a level of user anonymity, whether carrying out online exploration, expression or interaction. This dissertation represents a study of the relationship between young people and internet anonymity. The main goal of the research is to examine how young people understand internet anonymity and its effects in addition to what psychological and socio-?-demographic characteristics are linked to preferring anonymous expression online. Four studies were constructed for the purpose of this aim, each bringing a unique perspective to the discussion of internet anonymity through both past theoretical frameworks and previous studies on the online behavior of young people. Results of these studies highlighted various ways in which online anonymity provides avenues for meeting the needs of young people through forms of beneficial social invisibility while also being viewed as a cause for certain risks due to the lack of accountability for aggressors. Overall, the studies allowed for the effects of anonymity to be linked as both cause and facilitator to various opportunities and risks found in past research concerning online behavior. Furthermore, the identification of characteristics of those preferring anonymity online provided a bridge between anonymity studies and studies on internet use toward a new perspective of how the structural nature of the internet can appeal to users. Finally, the various findings along with the development of a model of contemporary internet anonymity provide points of reference for future research while also highlighting existing gaps in the study of young people online.},

	abstract = {Despite being the focus of academic studies for close to two decades and a signifi- cant part of popular culture for much longer, the humanities generally and cultur- al studies in particular lacks a coherent vocabulary to perform strong, analytical criticism of individual videogame works. The solution is not another prescriptive, top-down model that attempts to understand all videogame play the same way, but a descriptive, bottom-up conceptual toolkit that understands particular videogames in the moment of play when videogame and player come together. This article high- lights the values inherited by game studies that have resisted the creation of such a toolkit and suggests one path forward grounded in the phenomenological pleasures of videogame play across worlds and bodies. After exploring game studies{\textquoteright} historical hostility to critical and textual readings, it conceptualises the {\textquoteleft}videogame text{\textquoteright}{\textemdash}the critic{\textquoteright}s object of study{\textemdash}as the coming together of the player and the videogame in a cybernetic circuit of embodied pleasures. This circuit flows across both the actual and virtual worlds of play in a convergence of form and content. Ultimately, this article lays a groundwork for academic roads into videogame criticism that is primarily concerned with understanding videogames as videogames to complement those ad-hoc methods already being developed by a nascent scene of online critics and bloggers.},

	abstract = {Videogames require robust yet flexible methods and vocabularies of critical analysis that appreciate both the textual and embodied pleasures of players. Such analysis cannot start with the player{\textquoteright}s intentions as an autonomous user nor with the videogame as a stable object; rather, it must account for the dynamic interplay between videogame hardware, sensorial perception, and audiovisual and haptic representations. If it is to understand how a particular videogame is engaged as both textual artefact and embodied practice, such analysis must be concerned with not just what the player does with the videogame, but what the videogame does with the player. This thesis forwards a phenomenology of videogame experience to account for how the player and the videogame incorporate each other in reflexive cycles that mediate presence, attention, perception, and agency. It does not hope to understand videogames either {\textquoteleft}as narratives{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}as games{\textquoteright} but as particular amalgamations of existing and nascent media and forms{\textemdash}it hopes to understand videogames as videogames. It explores videogame play as a convergence of eyes-on-screens, ears-at-speakers, and muscles-against-interfaces to interrogate the limits of current game studies approaches that often obscure rich commonalities between videogames and other media forms. Drawing upon phenomenology, posthumanism, and cyborg theory, and embedded in detailed and multifaceted analyses of various videogames on different platforms as played, this thesis develops nuanced understandings of how the player and the videogame come together during play to form particular modes of embodiment through which a videogame work is both interpreted and perceived.},

The article problematizes discourses examining fundamentalism's role as the West's Other and the source of its identity by analysing the complicated political role that fundamentalism plays in Egypt as an Islamic' democracy. Islamic fundamentalism is explored as an Other in Egyptian cinema that is used as a tool for strengthening Egyptian national identity. The article thus reveals the cultural tensions and power struggles present within Egypt as a nation caught between modernity and extremism. The article's highlighting of the processes of Otherness within the East' itself reveals the limitation of the idea of an East/West dichotomy.},

It starts from the premise that aesthetic form, perhaps the central category of modernist critical theory, is present in our play with computer games. The central argument is that controllers and our use of them are repressed in gameplay and that this repression facilitates a diversion of the player{\textquoteright}s energy that helps explain the compulsive nature of good games. Our sense of participation in events in game fiction is bought at the price of a loss of interest in our hands. The smooth integration of players into the rough, faltering world of gameplay is made possible by an excess of energy that passes from the unacknowledged tension in the hand into the imaginary relation we have with on-screen action.},

We have found that some of the translations and rotations made by players of this video game are best understood as actions that use the world to improve cognition. These actions are not used to implement a plan, or to implement a reaction; they are used to change the world in order to simplify the problem-solving mentally. To illustrate task. Thus, we distinguish performed to uncover informatioan actions performed to bring one physically closer to a goal-from -actions information-processing pragmatic octions-- epistemic actions that is hidden or hard to compute the need for epistemic actions, we first develop a standard model of Tetris cognition and show that it cannot explain performance data from human players of the game-even when we relax the assumption of fully sequential processing. Standard models disregard many actions taken by players because they appear unmotivated or superfluous. How- ever, we show that such actions are actually far from superfluous; they play a valuable role in improving human performance. We argue that traditional accounts are limited because they regard action as having o single function: to change the world. By recognizing a second function of action-an tion-we epistemic func- can explain many of the actions that a traditional model cannot. Al- though our argument is supported by numerous examples specifically from Tetris, we outline how the new category of epistemic action can be incorporated into theories of action more generally.},

	abstract = {In 1976, Exidy's Death Race triggered the United States{\textquoteright} first video gaming moral panic. Public outrage not only fueled sales of the game and made Exidy a household name, but established a pattern by which controversial games receive a high levels of press attention, which in turn drives these games' marketplace success. Exidy released Death Race in the midst of changing cinema production codes and distribution regulations that led to the emergence of films featuring unprecedented displays of violence and sexuality. The game is based on one of these films, Death Race 2000, in which competitors in the Annual Transcontinental Road Race mow down pedestrians for points. Although the filmmakers did not authorize the use of their concepts for the game, the game relies directly on the film's narrative. The chase-and-crash game invites players to strike stick-figure "gremlins" with on-screen cars. Context, including the game's cabinet graphics and the film, contributed to moral guardians' perception that the game was celebrating violence. However, Death Race was distributed in a market filled with numerous other violent games. This suggests the game triggered outrage not only because it was violent, but because it depicted violence which questioned the state's monopoly on legitimized violence and did not follow culturally accepted narratives of violence, such as military or police violence, or the western. Public disapproval of Death Race did not squelch distribution, instead driving sales and vaulting Exidy into the national spotlight. Discourse surrounding Death Race forged a strong tie between video gaming and violence in the public imagination, ensuring the development of similarly violent games. This bond has persisted and led to the development of several similar games, including the controversial Grand Theft Auto franchise, which is the progeny of Death Race in both narrative theme and reception.},

	abstract = {George Wilson has recently defended Kripke's well-known interpretation of Wittgenstein against the criticisms of John McDowell. Wilson claims that these criticisms rest on misunderstandings of Kripke and that, when correctly understood, Kripke's interpretation stands up to them well. In particular, Wilson defends Kripke's Wittgenstein against the charge of "non-factualism" about meaning. However, Wilson has not appreciated the full significance of McDowell's criticism. I use a brief exploration of Kripke's analogy between Wittgenstein and Hume to put this significance in sharp relief. It emerges that McDowell's response to Kripke's Wittgenstein account of meaning is in important respects analogous to Kant's response to Hume's account of causality, par- ticularly Kant's complaint that Hume reduced the objective necessity of the causal nexus to a merely subjective necessity. In the same way Kripke's Wittgenstein reduces the objective normative force of meanings to a "quasi-subjective," community-relative status.},

While most of these approaches employ a two- level model with undeniable roots in structuralist narratology, the model suggested here is based on the constructivist concept of viability. This presupposes a change of perspective from {\textquotedblleft}na{\"i}ve objectivity{\textquotedblright} to informed subjectivity.},

The primary goal is to gain experience in the field of transmedia design. The purpose is thus to develop the intellectual property of Stupid Stupid Games towards spreadability and growth. The thesis is made of theory section and an analysis section. The theory section examines the transmedia writings of Jesse Schell, Jeff Gomez, Tim Dowd, Michael Fry, Michael Nie- derman and Josef Steiff. The aim was to find similarities in the writings and to come up with a short list of factors that the authors considered crucial to transmedia. In the analysis section the author compares these factors to successful intellectual properties of entertainment com- panies. The analysis shows that the factors have a bearing on the longevity and spreadability of these properties. The factors work as a foundation for future studies in how to design content for video games as intellectual property. The results have had an impact on how Stupid Stupid Games de- signed content for Johnny Graves {\textendash}The Bastard Son of Satan {\textendash}computer game. Keywords},

For example improvisational theatre, Augusto Boal, psycho drama, and environmental theatre have all received their share of attention in the pursuit of a functional theory base for larping. Using theatre studies can help in mapping out the nature of larping by showing what it is not. But what can be done to locate the {\textquoteleft}yeses{\textquoteright}? To offer another theoretical framework for larps as performances, this paper suggests the use of Performance Studies. Therefore, this paper will discuss the matter of larps, theatre and performance by, first, analysing the problems included in applying Theatre Studies for the exploration of the performance nature of larping, and second, by providing the reader with an introduction to Performance Studies and its possible usage on depicting the activity. It will be suggested that larp, essentially, is not theatre because the latter emphasises perception whereas the former emphasises action. Instead, this paper proposes that larping could be more precisely described as transportative performatic behaviour.},

	abstract = {Sampling strategies have critical implications for the validity of a researcher's conclusions. Despite this, sampling is frequently ignored in research methods textbooks, during the research design process, and in the reporting of our journals. This lack of guidance often leads reviewers and journal editors to consider sampling using simple rules of thumb, which leads to the unnecessary and counterproductive characterization of sampling strategies as universally "good" or "bad." Such oversimplification slows the progress of our science by considering legitimate data sources to be categorically unacceptable. Instead, we argue that sampling is better understood in methodological terms of range restriction and omitted variables bias. This considered approach has far-reaching implications, because in I/O psychology, as in most social sciences, virtually all of our samples are convenience samples. Organizational samples are not gold standard research sources; instead, they are merely a specific type of convenience sample with their own positive and negative implications for validity. This fact does not condemn our science but instead highlights the need for more careful consideration of how and when a finding may generalize based upon the particular mix of validity-related affordances provided by each sample source that might be used to investigate a particular research question. We call for researchers to explore such considerations cautiously and explicitly in both the publication and review of research.},

Engagement with player characters can be goal-related or empathic, where goal-related engagement depends on affects elicited by goal-status evaluations whereas characters facilitate empathic engagement. The concepts of recognition, alignment, and allegiance are used to describe how engagement is structured in games. Recognition describes aspects of character interpretation. Alignment describes what kind of access players have to a character's actions, knowledge, and affects. Allegiance describes how characters elicit sympathy or antipathy through positive or negative evaluation of the character.},

To do this, it is vital to deepen our knowledge of European videogame history and its main actors' (designers, development studios, publishers) as well as the creative traits of European videogame production. This article aims to contribute to raising this awareness.

With this aim, an analysis model is constructed based on game design theory and studies of the expressive potential of video games. This model is based on the following three facets of the video game discourse: (1) the rep- resentation of the character/player, (2) the game world, and (3) the main actions carried out in it. The fundamental resources of the ludic design and their expressive value are discussed in depth for each aspect. The model is applied to acasestudy of Grand Theft Auto IV.},

	abstract = {While the mainstream press have often used the accusation of trolling to cover almost any form of online abuse, the term itself has a long and changing history. In scholarly work, trolling has morphed from a description of newsgroup and discussion board commentators who appeared genuine but were actually just provocateurs, through to contemporary analyses which focus on the anonymity, memes and abusive comments most clearly represented by users of the iconic online image board 4chan, and, at times, the related Anonymous political movement. To explore more mainstream examples of what might appear to be trolling at first glance, this paper analyses the Channel Nine Fail (Ch9Fail) Facebook group which formed in protest against the quality of the publicly broadcast Olympic Games coverage in Australia in 2012. While utilising many tools of trolling, such as the use of memes, deliberately provocative humour and language, targeting celebrities, and attempting to provoke media attention, this paper argues that the Ch9Fail group actually demonstrates the increasingly mainstream nature of many online communication strategies once associated with trolls. The mainstreaming of certain activities which have typified trolling highlight these techniques as part of a more banal everyday digital discourse; despite mainstream media presenting trolls are extremist provocateurs, many who partake in trolling techniques are simply ordinary citizens expressing themselves online. http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-163-olympic-trolls-mainstream-memes-and-digital-discord/},

	abstract = {This study provides an account of how richness occurs in communication that uses electronic mail. In examining actual e-mail exchanged among managers in a corporation, the study interprets the managerial use of the communication medium of electronic mail as the users themselves understand and experience it. Employing the research approach of interpretivism in general and hermeneutics in particular, the study finds that richness or leanness is not an inherent property of the electronic-mail medium, but an emergent property of the interaction of the electronic-mail medium with its organizational context, where the interaction is described in terms of distanciation, autonomization, social construction, appropriation, and enactment. Conclusions and recommendations are that managers who receive e-mail are not passive recipients of data, but active producers of meaning; that the best or just an appropriate communication medium is not determined through an individual manager's exercise of rational decision making, but emerges as best or appropriate over time, over the course of the medium's interactions with many users, that systems professionals need to treat the managerial user of an e-mail system not merely as a client of information services, but also as a processor or co-processor to be integrated into the system design; and that information systems researchers need to dedicate attention to the actual processes by which the users of a communication medium come to understand themselves, their own use of the medium, and their organizational context.},

After an extensive explication process, presence is newly defined as {\textquotedblleft}a psychological state in which virtual objects are experienced as actual ob- jects in either sensory or nonsensory ways.{\textquotedblright} Three types of presence{\textemdash}physical, social, and self presence{\textemdash}are defined based on the general definition of pres- ence and the corresponding domains of human experience.

Using the 2001 Home Office Citizenship Survey, we identify four types of political participant: Political Activists, Expert Citizens, Everyday Makers and Non-Participants. We assess the socio-demographic and cultural factors underlying these different types of participant. We then move on to explore the association between the types of political participation and two domains of political beliefs/actions: political trust and efficacy; and political contacting and voice. Our analysis shows significant differences between the types of participant in the two domains under investigation and thus lends support to our development of Bang{\textquoteright}s conceptualization},

Two tabletop aug- mented reality games have been designed and implemented including a racing game and a pile game. The goal of the augmented reality racing game is to start the car and move around the track without colliding with either the wall or the objects that exist in the gaming arena. Initial evaluation re- sults showed that multimodal-based interaction games can be beneficial in gaming. Based on these results, an aug- mented reality pile game was implemented with goal of completing a circuit of pipes (from a starting point to an end point on a grid). Initial evaluation showed that tangible inter- action is preferred to keyboard interaction and that tangible games are much more enjoyable.},

Studies of game elements in nongame contexts tend to describe full packages, with no way of assessing their individual psychological and functional impact. To isolate the effects of framing, students (N {\textonequarter} 90) were assigned to either discuss study environment issues through a list of questions, via a competitive discussion board game, or though the same game artifacts but with no game mechanics. Task engagement and self-reported intrinsic motivation were compared between groups. Results demonstrate that the effects of simply framing the activity as a game though vernacular and artifacts holds almost as much psycho- logical power as the full game mechanics. In both game conditions, interest and enjoyment were significantly superior to controls, but other intrinsic motivation variables remained unchanged. Implications for game design in nongame contexts are discussed, and a framework for differentiating {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}deep and shallow gamification{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} in terms of mechanics and framing is developed.},

According to this perspective, gameplay can be described in terms of perceiving, acting on and transforming the affordances that are related to a game system or to other players in a game. Challenges in games have an emphasis on perceiving suitable actions and/or performing suitable actions, often with emphasis on one aspect. For example, in many board games, strategy games and puzzle games, the challenge is to perceive appropriate affordances while in many sports, multiplayer shooter games, racing games, etc. the challenge is to use appropriate affordances. From this follows that the ecological approach to gameplay overrides the division of games as being digital and non-digital games.},

Grounded in a tradition of philosophical hermeneutics, it is possible to approach the understanding of gameplay as a matter of generating mappings to explanatory frameworks in alternative interpretation paradigms. It is especially useful to consider gameplay from perspectives of cognitive science, semiotics, consciousness studies and aesthetics. Each of these approaches provides a different but compatible perspective on understanding play. Integrating these perspectives without losing their differences provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for play analysis.},

The paper focuses on how the game user interface influences the players{\textquoteright} involvement in the game, and how the players navigate between different sources of involvement. We argue that there is no necessary connection between a transparent interface and involvement, and that in many cases, overlay interfaces are preferred due to the clear information they present. With point of departure in Ermi \& M{\"a}yra{\textquoteright}s (2005) view of player involvement as a complex phenomenon, and J{\o}rgensen{\textquoteright}s (2010; forthcoming) research into the relationship between game user interfaces and the gameworld, we discuss how players in our qualitative study see involvement with respect to how the game UI is presented. This framework also enables us to discuss user interface design as a balancing act between aesthetics and mechanics, as the choice between transparent or superimposed interface features is a way to represent system information within the game context.},

	abstract = {Since Lara first {\textquotedblleft}bust{\textquotedblright} onto our screens in 1996 in Tomb Raider (Edios Interactive), she has been a focal point for critical debate surrounding the representation of the female protagonist and the gendered body in games. Nearly twenty years after her first appearance, the 2013 version of Tomb Raider (Crystal Dynamics) remakes Lara with a new body, a new author, and has sent her out towards a new generation of fans. In line with attempts by the games industry to provide a more appealing female protagonist, Lara has been significantly altered physically and in terms of her attitude, but what is perhaps most striking is the way that her narrative has also been redefined by a female writer, and then taken even further by a more gender-savvy fanbase willing to give Lara a second chance. This paper examines the 2013 iteration of Tomb Raider in the light of previous scholarship, arguing that despite, as Kirkland argues {\textquotedblleft}The meaning of the controllable figure {\textquoteleft}Lara Croft{\textquoteright} within the Tomb Raider series is inseparable from the paratexts that surround it{\textquotedblright} (Kirkland, 2014), that critics have often used Lara{\textquoteright}s sexualised appearance to unfairly dismiss the players who see her as an icon or those that have simply enjoyed playing with and through her for nearly 20 years. Critically, her body and her gender have been seen as indistinguishable, and this is used in turn to disenfranchise the experience of the player who controls her. I will also consider how new ways of consuming games -- most notably through webcasting playthroughs -- are working to change the ways in which gender is formulated in digital games. Here, games are reframed by the fan producers who overlay narratives on top of the existing text, reinterpreting it in ways that provide interesting new readings of how Lara is understood by her own players.},

Such results have been interpreted as indicating that concepts, and important aspects of cognition more broadly, are embodied. That conclusion does not follow from the empirical evidence. The reason why is that the empirical evidence can equally be accommodated by a 'disembodied' view of conceptual representation that makes explicit assumptions about spreading activation between the conceptual and sensory and motor systems. At the same time, the strong form of the embodied cognition hypothesis is at variance with currently available neuropsychological evidence. We suggest a middle ground between the embodied and disembodied cognition hypotheses--grounding by interaction. This hypothesis combines the view that concepts are, at some level, 'abstract' and 'symbolic', with the idea that sensory and motor information may 'instantiate' online conceptual processing.},

The author offers a new approach to games that stresses them as characterized by process. Games, the author argues, are domains of contrived contingency, capable of generating emergent practices and interpretations, and are intimately connected with everyday life to a degree heretofore poorly understood. This approach is both consistent with a range of existing social theory and avoids many of the limitations that have characterized much games scholarship to date, in particular its tendency toward unsustainable formalism and exceptionalism. Rather than seeing gaming as a subset of play, and therefore as an activity that is inherently separable, safe, and pleasurable, the author offers a pragmatic rethinking of games as social artifacts in their own right that are always in the process of becoming. This view both better accords with the experience of games by participants cross-culturally and bears the weight of the new questions being asked about games and about society.},

Image-schemas create conceptual structure from the spatial structure of objects and their movements, resulting in notions such as animacy, inanimacy, agency, and containment. These earliest meanings are nonpropositional, analogical representations grounded in the perceptual world of the infant. In contrast with most perceptual processing, which is not analyzed in this fashion, redescription into image-schematic format simplifies perceptual information and makes it potentially accessible for purposes of concept formation and thought. In addition to enabling preverbal thought, image-schemas provide a foundation for language acquisition by creating an interface between the continuous processes of perception and the discrete nature of language.},

We created a hybrid game that leverages the advantages of both physical and digital media. A custom sensor interface promotes physical interaction around the shared public display while the un-oriented tabletop display encourages players to focus on each other rather than on the interface to the game. The ensuing social interactions define the course that the game takes, while the computer enhances the gaming experience by completing the menial tasks and providing dynamic, exciting environments. Our hybrid board/video game has the potential to enhance natural and enjoyable recreational interaction between friends.},

	abstract = {Whimsy describes the capricious, playful and fanciful, and designates something irrational or without an immediately obvious reason to exist. I argue that this frivolity and illogicality are precisely what can make whimsy a significant, if fleeting, ground for micro-political change. To demonstrate this claim I use the example of yarn bombing {\textendash} a contemporary form of street art in which knitted and crocheted items are attached to parts of the urban landscape. Yarn bombing, I argue, does more than feminise the city, for the whimsy with which it is imbued has the capacity to increase our attentiveness to habitual worlds in a series of micro-political gestures. Yet it is impossible to fully recognise and harness a politics of whimsy, for doing so defies its character as frivolous and without motive, and supersedes these traits with intentionality and utility. As a result, a politics born of whimsy is always-already a paradoxical politics. The broader question thus becomes one of how to dwell in whimsy{\textquoteright}s ungraspable moment in order that we might remain open to newpolitical and ethical potentialities.To explore these issues, this paper draws on performative ethnographic fieldwork, wherein 30 yarn bombs were made and displayed in the city of Bristol during 2011.},

Recently, however, many have started to question (a) whether this is possible and (b) what, after all, this project could achieve. An alternative vision of the task of moral philosophy starts from the pragmatist idea that philosophizing begins and ends in human experiencing. It leads to a view where morality is seen as a {\textquotedblleft}social technology{\textquotedblright} that aims to make living together possible, and strengthens people?s capability to live a good life within a society. The role of moral philosophy is, accordingly, to develop our moral tools further. Moral philosophers become ethical engineers who use their expertise in ethical topics to criticize existing {\textquotedblleft}moral technology{\textquotedblright} and construct new concepts, tools, and theories that better answer the current challenges for living a good life.},

	abstract = {As players craft and enact embodiment in digital games, the relationship between social interaction and gender (male/female) versus gender-role identity (masculinity/femininity) remains unclear. This paper examines differences in chat, avatar movement, and avatar appearance among male players who played male and female avatars. Initial analysis reveals that gender-based playstyles are distinct from gender role-based playstyles. Most importantly, men playing female avatars retain patterns typical of male players; however they depart from patterns typical of high-masculinity players. Specifically, gender-switching males tended to reject masculine behaviors in favor of flirting, using more punctuation, and deferring physical leadership. We interpret this to mean that male gender-switchers do not shed male behaviors and, instead of performing normatively feminine behaviors, work to counteract masculine behaviors {\textendash} they try to act {\textquotedblleft}not-masculine.{\textquotedblright} These findings have implications for gameplay scholarship where offline gender is unknown and for integrating gender roles as key to studying gender in games.},

However, geek culture is becoming increasingly mainstream; for example, in the past year alone, Dragon*Con, a major Geek convention in Atlanta, Georgia, attracted an attendance of over 57,000 mem- bers. The present article uses an individual differences approach to examine three theoreti- cal accounts of geek culture. Seven studies (N = 2354) develop the Geek Culture Engagement Scale (GCES) to quantify geek engagement and assess its relationships to theoretically relevant personality and individual differences variables. These studies pres- ent evidence that individuals may engage in geek culture in order to maintain narcissistic self-views (the great fantasy migration hypothesis), to fulfill belongingness needs (the belongingness hypothesis), and to satisfy needs for creative expression (the need for engagement hypothesis). Geek engagement is found to be associated with elevated grandi- ose narcissism, extraversion, openness to experience, depression, and subjective well- being across multiple samples. These data lay the groundwork for further exploration of geek culture as well as provide a foundation for examining other forms of subculture participation.},

At stake in the dense and volatile debate that ensued, and in the acts of violence themselves, were contests over spaces as well as competing models of democracy, publics and citizenship, including the appropriate use of social media. Within these debates, almost universally, rational deliberative discourse and action is assumed to be the only route to legitimate {\textquotedblleft}civil{\textquotedblright} society. So what is to be made of the violent physical contest over city squares, streets and property, as well as contests over acts of participation and demonstration played out online through the hundreds of eyewitness videos posted to sites like YouTube and the endless flow of often vitriolic words in blogs, comments spaces and social network sites? This paper uses a video posted to YouTube titled {\textquoteleft}Clapham Junction Speaker (London Riots 2011){\textquoteright} to examine the passion and provocation that flowed beyond the city streets to enliven, intensify and sustain forms of protest and civic engagement. We argue that the aggressive and antagonistic tenor of the Speaker{\textquoteright}s twenty minute monologue, the bitter vitriol that flowed through the comments space, and even the act of posting it constitute significant elements of a generative, {\textquoteleft}agonistic{\textquoteright} public, to use Chantal Mouffe{\textquoteright}s term, that operates in multiple spaces and outside of the rationalising discourse demanded by mainstream media and government. This paper develops a richer understanding of these spaces of protest, and the concept of provocation central to these events.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nhttp://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-161-productive-provocations-vitriolic-media-spaces-of-protest-and-agonistic-outrage-in-the-2011-england-riots/},

It constructs a genealogy by following the idea of a to-and-fro motion characterizing play through Huizinga{\textquoteright}s Homo Ludens, to Gadamer{\textquoteright}s Truth and Method, and finally to Nicolas Abraham{\textquoteright}s essays on the phenomenology of rhythm. By looking at play as a selection of game acts, it is understood as having a style of its own that opens it up to microanalysis and interpretation. By opening up new rhythms and new ways of comporting one{\textquoteright}s body, play is understood to have a radical connection with the experience of time, and the analysis ends with some speculation on the nature of their relation.

A decade of research has thrown light on many aspects of the Wikipedia community, its processes, and content. However, due to the variety of the fields inquiring about Wikipedia and the limited synthesis of the extensive research, there is little consensus on many aspects of Wikipedia{\textquoteright}s content as an encyclopedic collection of human knowledge. This study addresses the issue by systematically reviewing 110 peer-reviewed publications on Wikipedia content, summarizing the current findings, and highlighting the major research trends. Two major streams of research are identified: the quality of Wikipedia content (including comprehensiveness, currency, readability and reliability) and the size of Wikipedia. Moreover, we present the key research trends in terms of the domains of inquiry, research design, data source, and data gathering methods. This review synthesizes scholarly understanding of Wikipedia content and paves the way for future studies.},

	abstract = {Using social media for political discourse is increasingly becoming common practice, especially around election time. Arguably, one of the most interesting aspects of this trend is the possibility of ''pulsing'' the public's opinion in near real-time and, thus, it has attracted the interest of many researchers as well as news organizations. Recently, it has been reported that predicting electoral outcomes from social media data is feasible, in fact it is quite simple to compute. Positive results have been reported in a few occasions, but without an analysis on what principle enables them. This, however, should be surprising given the significant differences in the demographics between likely voters and users of online social networks. This work aims to test the predictive power of social media metrics against several Senate races of the two recent US Congressional elections. We review the findings of other researchers and we try to duplicate their findings both in terms of data volume and sentiment analysis. Our research aim is to shed light on why predictions of electoral (or other social events) using social media might or might not be feasible. In this paper, we offer two conclusions and a proposal: First, we find that electoral predictions using the published research methods on Twitter data are not better than chance. Second, we reveal some major challenges that limit the predictability of election results through data from social media. We propose a set of standards that any theory aiming to predict elections (or other social events) using social media should follow.},

	abstract = {A 12-year ethnography illustrates how two investment banks' participative work practices entrapped bankers in indiscriminate overwork, and what the evolving consequences were for the banks and the organizations that the bankers joined subsequently. The banks' participative work practices eliminated all visible organizational controls. Invested in the task, the bankers collectively designed work practices that benefited the banks, but had the unintended consequences of intensifying work pace and habituating bankers to indiscriminate overwork that they experienced as self-chosen. Prior organizational behavioral research predicts outcomes only for about one year. During this time, the banks benefited from the bankers' hard work. Starting in year four, the practices' extremes produced opposite effects, namely declining performance because of body breakdowns, and cultural distance, because depleted bodies made it impossible for bankers to work in culturally normative ways. The bankers carried this pattern of overwork and subsequent breakdowns into the organizations that they joined subsequently, where they introduced the banks' practices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Midwest Sociological Society.},

Festi- vus is found to be primarily constructed as a playful rejection of the established grand narratives and conventions of Christmas. In contrast to dominant Christmas ideology, Festivus promotes a grand narrative of {\textquotedblleft}meaningful nothingness,{\textquotedblright} wherein Festivus celebration is presented a viable means of circumventing the oppressiveness of Christmas (i.e. {\textquotedblleft}meaningful{\textquotedblright}) through erasing the higher goals and conventions if Christmas (i.e. {\textquotedblleft}nothingness{\textquotedblright}). Our contribution is threefold: (i) we demonstrate the role of parody in consumer resistance; (ii) we outline the subversively playful nature of parodic consumer resistance; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate how parodic holiday celebration unsettles dominant discourses and conventions.},

	abstract = {4chan and reddit[throughout we have issues with the capitalisation of reddit or Reddit] are participatory media collectives undergirded by a {\textquotedblleft}logic of lulz{\textquotedblright} that favours distanced irony and critique. It often works at the expense of core identity categories like race and gender. However, the logic need not be entirely counterproductive to public discourse. Provided that diverse identities find voice instead of exclusion, these sites may facilitate vibrant, agonistic discussion instead of disenfranchising antagonism. In order to assess this potential for productive agonism, I undertook a critical discourse analysis of these collectives. Emphasising the image memes they produce, I evaluated discourses on race and gender. Both race and gender representations were dominated by familiar stereotypes and partial representations.

The {\textquoteleft}logic of lulz{\textquoteright} facilitated both dominance and counter, each articulated with heavy reliance on irony and critique. This logic ambiguously balanced agonism and antagonism, but contestation provided sharper engagement than repression.},

Memes are a form of {\textquoteleft}vernacular creativity{\textquoteright}, which balance the familiar and the foreign, the collective and the individual. In order to assess this balance, I undertook a yearlong multimodal discourse analysis of the networks of mediated cultural participation that house memes. Analyzing memes on sites like 4chan, Reddit, and Tumblr, I found they depend upon {\textquoteleft}prepatterning{\textquoteright} from social contexts understood by the collectives creating, reappropriating, and sharing them. While this prepatterning fixes the conversation and restricts participation, it also affords depth and expression. Understanding fixed conversational contexts means novel expression translatable to a receptive audience. In this way, memes are a {\textquoteleft}media lingua franca{\textquoteright}, discourses understood by a far reaching collective. Two case studies {\textendash} {\textquoteleft}Kanye Interrupts{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}Not Bad Obama{\textquoteright} {\textendash} support this assertion.},

Central to the discussion were Internet memes. Memes are multimodal artifacts remixed by countless participants, employing popular culture for public commentary. Analyzing the use of memes in political discourse can illuminate the nature of mediated commentary on public events. This article examines how memes were used to articulate perspectives on OWS. A corpus of memes commenting on OWS from multiple participatory media networks was analyzed using multimodal critical discourse analysis. Findings indicated memes facilitated conversation between diverse positions. OWS memes employed populist argument and popular texts, intertwining them into a vibrant polyvocal public discourse.},

	url = {http://www.ijrp.subcultures.nl/wp-content/issue4/IJRPissue4mochocki.pdf},
	abstract = {The paper presents theoretical foundations of the author's approach to the design of edu-larps. It is deliberately steering away from cross-disciplinary teaching, artistic education or soft skills training in order to advocate larps tailored to single school subjects, focused on integration and consolidation of curricular knowledge. Putting larp in the context of applied drama, or Drama in Education, the text argues that well-designed edu-larp is likely to be accepted by the average teacher, not just by dedicated and trained drama educators. The concept of print-and-play {\textquotedblleft}larp for dummies{\textquotedblright} downplays the importance of preparation, acting and immersion, while emphasising the game-like structure of goals and conflicts: gameplay set to work alongside role-play. Therefore, the ideas and tools borrowed from video games and board games design can be useful in the creation of edu-role plays, breeding a form which might be called 'gamified drama'. The recommended function for edu-larps is final revision of a large textbook unit, an idea discussed on the example of high-school history classes. The suggested model for classrom larp is a negotiation game between conflicted but cooperating factions, divided into three stages: a) preparation of all factions separately; b) informal meeting of all factions shortly before the official talks; c) official negotiation session which is supposed to bring forward all major (textbook-based!) issues for public debate. The paper ends with a section on troubleshooting, i.e. an overview of risk factors frequently pointed in the discussion of game-based learning, with ideas of how to eliminate or minimise the risks through careful design. Referenced sources come from the fields of edu- larp, edu-drama, game-based learning, and general educational theory.},

	title = {Generating {Narrative} {Variation} in {Interactive} {Fiction}},
	url = {http://gradworks.umi.com/3271851.pdf},
	abstract = {A general method for the generation of natural language narrative is described. It allows the expression, or narrative discourse, to vary independently of the underlying events and existents that are the narrative's content. Specifically, this variation is accomplished in an interactive fiction (IF) system which replies to typed input by narrating what has happened in a simulated world. IF works have existed for about 30 years as forms of text-based computer simulation, instances of dialog systems, and examples of literary art. Theorists of narrative have carefully distinguished between the level of underlying content (corresponding to the simulated world in interactive fiction) and that of expression (corresponding to the textual exchange between computer arnd user) since the mid-1960s, when the field of narratology began to develop, but IF systems have not yet made use of this distinction. The current project contributes new techniques for automatic narration by building on work done in computational linguistics, specifically natural language generation, and in narratology. First, types of narrative variation that are possible in IF are identified and formalized in a way that is suitable for a natural language generation system. An architecture for an IF system is then described and implemented; the result allows multiple works of interactive fiction to be realized and, using a general plan for narrating, allows them to be narrated in different ways during interaction. The system's ability to generate text is considered in a pilot evaluation. Plans for future work are also discussed. They include publicly released systems for IF development and narratology education, adding a planning capability that uses actors' individual perspectives, and adapting automatic narration to different sorts of interactive systems.},

	url = {http://mediafieldsjournal.squarespace.com/the-passenger-and-the-player/},
	abstract = {Airports represent contemporary forms of mobility {\textendash} existing as nodes that connect travelers and passengers to a series of other nodes within a global network of movement. The localized space of the airport itself is subject to such forms of global mobility {\textendash} providing a gateway to international travel. As such, the contemporary, post-9/11 airport is a highly regimented space of surveillance {\textendash} coding bodies and subjecting travelers to an ongoing forward and store flow of movement. This paper analyses the contemporary airport space and the possible subversions to surveillance-driven forms of mobility that the pervasive game Blowtooth offers. The game utilizes the surveillance space of the airport as the game space {\textendash} where players are required to discreetly distribute and then collect forms of illegal contraband. This paper focuses on two figures of mobility/immobility: the passenger-in-waiting and the player-in-waiting. Conceptualizing play as a form of mobility and as a potentially subversive act, this paper examines how Blowtooth works within the structures of the airport space, and the subsequent forms of mobility and immobility afforded to travelers. This paper argues that Blowtooth subverts the space of the airport not only via a provocative narrative, but by playing with forms of mobility and immobility, and the store and forward flow of people within these highly surveilled spaces.},

These discussions, however, tend to ignore the history of both games and of game studies.

These connections range from player style through game-play options to social interaction and player-controlled social modifiers within both types of games. The comparison is based on play, observation, and interviews with players in MUDs and in WoW.},

@phdthesis{moring_games_2013,
	title = {Games and {Metaphor}{\textendash}{A} critical analysis of the metaphor discourse in game studies},
	abstract = {This doctoral dissertation critically investigates how the concept of metaphor is used with regard to games in game studies. The goal is to provide the field with a self-understanding of its metaphor discourse which has not been researched so far. The thesis departs from the observation that the notion of metaphor has been present in the discourse of game studies since it emerged as an academic field and focuses on questions such as: What are the motivations and effects of calling games metaphors in the game studies discourse? Which problems arise from that with regard to other established concepts in game studies such as simulation and procedural rhetoric? How do concepts and insights of contemporary metaphor theory affect the applicability of the notion of metaphor with regard to games? Drawing on concepts from metaphor theory (in particular the cognitive linguistic view on metaphor), play and game theory, cultural theory, semiotics, linguistics, philosophy, and game studies it investigates the metaphor discourse of game studies in the fashion of a meta-study. The main part of this thesis is devoted to three particular problems which have been derived from observations in the overview of the current use of the notion of metaphor in game studies. Firstly, this thesis investigates is the conceptual relationship between the notions of metaphor, representation, and play. It therefore accounts for observations such that all three notions are present in non-computer game and play theory, theory of representation and art which all influenced game studies and argues for an equiprimordial relation between these three concepts. Secondly, this thesis deals with what is termed the metaphor-simulation dilemma which accounts for the observation that in game studies the notion of metaphor is very often used in close conceptual proximity with the concept of simulation to the extent that they become conceptually indistinguishable. The two notions are reconciled through the notion of the model and a case study will demonstrate that it is possible to think of simulations as based on metaphorically structured models. Thirdly, thesis deals with the observation that the concept of metaphor is referred to in game studies in particular when games are interpreted in terms of some existential topic. Usually addressed from the perspective of (procedural) game rhetoric games are called metaphors for struggle, life, death, love. On the basis of a criticism of procedural rhetoric this thesis will suggest a distinction between a textual hermeneutic and an existential hermeneutic of games in which the latter is primary. It suggests furthermore that metaphoric interpretation of games is usually a sort of text interpretation. This supports the argument of a general de-metaphorization of alleged metaphoric computer games.},

The authors are social scientists and health researchers with extensive experience in this rapidly expanding field. Qualitative research has become increasingly interdisciplinary and team oriented. The transition away from the lone-researcher approach to collaborative and inter-institutional research creates new challenges for designing and implementing qualitative research. The authors use examples from both American and international studies to show how working in teams affects research design, project management, data analysis, and the presentation of research findings. The book offers numerous approaches and methods for making team research more efficient and enhancing the quality of research findings throughout all stages of the research process. Topics covered include: project design and preparation; logistics; research ethics; political dimensions of collaborative research; data collection; transcription and data management; codebook development; data reduction and analysis; monitoring and quality control; and dissemination of results.},

	abstract = {A number of commentators have proposed adapting ele- ments derived from game mechanics to workplaces, to moti- vate employees via techniques that, the argument goes, have proven successful in a videogame context, and thus may have wider motivational applications. This general strategy has become grouped under the term {\textquotedblleft}gamification{\textquotedblright}. I argue the gamification-of-work movement has at least two major pre- cursors, one in the Soviet Union of the early to mid 20th century, and another in American management of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The Soviet approach focused on games to increase productivity, via experiments ranging from purely competitive games directly tied to productivity, to attempts at morale-building via team games and work- place self-expression. The American management approach focused more strongly on a sense of childhood play, aim- ing to weaken the work/play split, but often with games and competition integrated into the framework. Neither ap- proach is identical to the gamification-of-work movement, but there exist significant overlaps, and thus both the his- torical movements themselves, and the critiques that have been directed at them, should be studied in order to bet- ter understand how to approach current attempts in light of past experiences.},

Departing from this ideal, activism is approached in terms of processes of identification by establishing conflictual frontiers to outside others as either adversaries or enemies. On the basis of these discussions, we outline a typology of four kinds of activists, namely the salon activist, the contentious activist, the law-abiding activist and the Gand- hian activist. The typology{\textquoteright}s first axis, between antagonism and agonism, is derived from normative discussions in radical democracy concerning developing frontiers. The second axis, about readi- ness to engage in civil disobedience, is derived from a review of studies of different forms of online activism. The article concludes by suggesting that the different forms of political engagement online have to be taken into account when studying how online activism can contribute to social change.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates Bal{\textquoteright}s concept of focalization for 3D video games. First, the argument traces focalization in the historical development of camera strategies in 3D video games. It highlights the detachment of the camera into an own interactive operator. Then, it exemplifies the visual focalization in video games using two case studies. In the following, it looks at possible problems and effects of focalization. The argument concludes that dynamic focalization allows video games to apply narrative guidance without the linearity of a {\textquotedblleft}telling{\textquotedblright} voice.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {Gamification, the idea that game mechanics can be integrated into assumed {\textquotedblleft}non-game{\textquotedblright} circumstances has gained ascendance amongst champions of marketing, behavior change and efficiency. Ironically, some of the most heated critique of gamification has come from the broader community of {\textquotedblleft}traditional{\textquotedblright} videogame developers. Connecting broadly to projects surrounding {\textquotedblleft}big data{\textquotedblright} and algorithmic surveillance, the project of gamification continues to expand and intensify. This paper examines the complex relationship between game designers and the rise of arguments in support of gamification. I analyze the various actors and interests mobilizing arguments, deconstructing their underlying assumptions about the relationship between games and social phenomena. Turning to an analytic framework rooted in the Assemblage of Play (Taylor 2009) and emergent coercive forms of (played) control (Taylor 2006), the essay critiques assumptions on either side of the debate on the role of games and play. The strained connections between debates on gamification and broader interest in serious games offers an important moment to explore algorithmic surveillance.},

In addition, collaborative AR allows multiple participants to simultaneously share the physical space surrounding them and a virtual space that is visually registered with the physical one. They can also communicate with each other through the mixed space. This paper describes the AR2Hockey (Augmented Reality AiR Hockey) system, where players can share a physical game field and mallets, and a virtual puck to play an air-hockey game, as a case study of a collaborative AR system. Since real-time accurate registration between both spaces and players is crucial for the collaboration, a video-rate registration algorithm is implemented with magnetic head-trackers and video cameras attached to optical see-through head-mounted displays (HMDs). The configuration of the system and the details of the registration are described. Our experimental collaborative AR system achieves higher interactivity than a totally immersive collaborative VR system.},

Persuasive applications aim at changing human attitudes or behavior through the power of software designs. This theory-creating article suggests the concept of a behavior change support system (BCSS), whether web-based, mobile, ubiquitous, or more traditional information system to be treated as the core of research into persuasion, influence, nudge, and coercion. This article provides a foundation for studying BCSSs, in which the key constructs are the O/C matrix and the PSD model. It will (1) introduce the archetypes of behavior change via BCSSs, (2) describe the design process for building per- suasive BCSSs, and (3) exemplify research into BCSSs through the domain of health interventions. Recognizing the themes put forward in this article will help leverage the full potential of computing for producing behavioral changes. Keywords},

We describe the use of a clock-driven business simulation for teaching 133 novices in business studies at the University of Turku, Finland. The students{\textquoteright} cognitive learning was evaluated based on data generated by pre- and post-game concept map tests designed to illustrate the formation and change of mental models during the simulation course. The results of this study suggest that simulation games can provide a solid basis for novice learning.

In this predicament {\textendash} aptly named as {\textquotedblleft}the war of all against all{\textquotedblright} {\textendash} people lived poor, short and brutish lives. The dystopian world simulated in the survival horror game DayZ mirrors this natural state of man. The game invites players to roleplay survivors of a zombie apocalypse. The present paper examines the factors contributing to pervasive violence, moral ambiguity and degeneration of human condition, which are prominent features of DayZ{\textquoteright}s gameplay. The article will situate DayZ into the context of Hobbesian state of nature and explicate elements that render this hypothetical condition perpetual.},

The present studycom- pared the socioemotional and task-oriented content of 5,826 text messages produced by participants of an online video game. The results suggest that participants produced sig- nificantly more socioemotional than task content. Consistent with predictions flowing from Social Information Processing Theory, the vast majority of messages were socio- emotional and positively valenced, despite the ostensible game objective of fighting other participants. Experience level played an important role in message production. More experienced participants produced both more positive and fewer negative socio- emotional messages than the less experienced and used more specialized language con- ventions (e.g., emoticons, scripted emotes, and abbreviations). The results are discussed in the context of previous research examining the effect of communication medium and interaction purpose on socioemotional and task message production.},

The OWS case study demonstrates how the rapid digital circulation of texts allows protestors to quickly build a geographically dispersed, networked counterpublic that can articulate a critique of power outside of the parameters of mainstream media. Furthermore, we find that the relay of pre-existing material was perceived to be just as meaningful a form of participation as drafting original compositions. By including these forwarding activities in their online efforts, these Twitter users worked to expand the circulation of information building and sustaining an OWS counterpublic. However, dependence on this external platform leaves protestors vulnerable to restrictions on their ability to communicate, as well as to unwanted surveillance from potentially hostile authorities.},

But, the radi- cally democratised access to media that this entailed indicated that the Habermasian line of theorising the public sphere needed revisions, particularly when applied to internet- based media on a supra-national scale. The contemporary public sphere tends towards a more dispersed structure than its 19th- and 20th-century versions critically analysed by J{\"u}rgen Habermas. In the 1960s, Habermas was highly critical of the intervention of large-scale commercial mass media into the public sphere but, in later writings, realised and appreciated the (quality) press{\textquoteright}s role in a modern public sphere (Habermas, 1989, 1996, 2008). The continuing structural transformation of the public sphere propelled by the internet has consequences for its normative power; its ability to provide legitimacy. From the perspective of formal politics, this forms a paradox: democratisation of media and an extended freedom of expression imply less power for formal politics to fulfil what is envisioned precisely as democratisation. With the expansion of the public sphere through digital media, politics will find it more difficult to identify normative founda- tions for legitimate decisions.},

The basis of this research is to investigate video games as a medium for social change, and its application within a political context in order to encourage political participation in the United Kingdom. The research intends to critically analyse existing video game design theories with implications of social impact, and provide existing examples of video game usage within political contexts.

	abstract = {Collaborative (or cooperative) games became very popular over the recent years. Aside from being received well by players, great collaborative games also offer the potential to train their players{\textquoteright} ability to work in teams. However, some other games include additional players without adapting their design appropriately, which may lead to games where the players hardly interact with each other and with little to none benefit when another player is present. This paper aims to improve this situation by introducing game design patterns for collaborative player interactions. Being extracted from well-received games, these patterns can be used as guidance for collaborative game designs fostering interaction between players. The interactions are classified along several dimensions (e.g. spatial and temporal) and can therefore be easily selected for specific situations. An example game design where some of these patterns were applied is also described.},

	abstract = {The now-famous equation, "knowledge is power" ("scientia potestas est"), was coined by Francis Bacon in 1597. Since then it has been rephrased in a wide variety of contexts from Thomas Hobbes to Michel Foucault. In recent years, this elusive topos has in fact proved essential to the poststructuralist critique of the humanist subject. Acknowledging the im- possibility of doing justice, in this essay, to the complexities of Bacon's and the poststructuralists' respective articulations of knowledge and power, I will focus primarily on a selection of significant aphorisms that encapsulate Bacon's main ideas on science and the state. In the second half of the essay I also assess Michel Foucault's immensely influential "knowledge/power" ("pouvoir/savoir") binomial. Both Bacon's and Foucault's ideas will be filtered through Pierre Bourdieu's restatement of hierarchically organized structures of knowledge and power. In the last few pages I bring into my discussion Foucault's later writings on ethics and disciplinarity - the so-called "final Foucault" or "1980s Foucault" - which allow the self both a greater degree of freedom and larger room for maneuver in organizing its resistance to the coercion of dominant powers. Whereas Foucault moves from his earlier suspicion of public forms of learning and their attending institutions (e.g., existing hierarchies, discursive conventions) to an instrumental appropriation by the self of that learning for the purposes of self-cultivation, both Bacon and Bourdieu seem to agree that power and knowledge are most clearly seen in the creation and self-reproduction of a professional class of experts in science and communication whose main interest is to keep control over official institutions of learning.},

	abstract = {Purpose {\textendash} Though not new to online gamers, griefing {\textendash} an act of play intended to cause grief to game players {\textendash} is fairly understudied in LIS scholarship. The purpose of this paper is to expand the inventory of griefing varieties, consider their deceptive elements and examine attitudes towards the phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach {\textendash} The authors collected and content analysed 80 (non-elicited) posts from the Something Awful forum thread and compared them to the results of ten (elicited) e-mail interviews. Findings {\textendash} As a complex phenomenon, griefing has multiple interpretations and opposing attitudes. The thread results show that griefers, as perpetrators, have predominantly positive or neutral attitudes towards the act. About 15 per cent of the examined griefers reportedly resort to deceptive techniques. More extravagant griefs that require verbal interactions in player-versus-player (PvP) online games involve deception and often fall into two categories: scamming or greed play (prioritising personal benefits). The authors found self-reported instances of deception by scheming, luring, entrapment, pretence and verbal concealment in griefing acts. The interview respondents, as predominantly victims of griefs, do not think of griefing (or may not be aware of it) as an act of deception and primarily associate it with harassment (inciting emotional reactions) or power imposition (exerting superiority). Casual griefing {\textendash} refusing to comply with the rules for mere entertainment {\textendash} stands out as another griefing variety. Originality/value {\textendash} With the growth of popularity of video gaming, libraries are largely unaware of griefing and should be prepared to address it in video game use policies for online gaming units or tournaments. Online gaming affords a unique opportunity to examine deception in computer-mediated human-to-human communication. The complexity of the phenomenon and associated opposing views are offered here to be weighted by the LIS scholars and professionals.},

Beyond the aesthetic, this metaphor may also increase the player{\textquoteright}s sensitivity to broader informatic or protocological control outside of the game world, a concept Alexander Galloway develops from Gilles Deleuze{\textquoteright}s Societies of Control.

	abstract = {This essay explores how theoretical physics, narratology, and narrative itself deal with the idea that reality consists of a plurality of worlds. In physics, the existence of parallel universes has been postulated on the cosmic level to describe what lies on the other side of black holes and, on the level of subatomic particles, to avoid the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. In narratology, the philosophical idea of a plurality of possible worlds and the contrast between the actual and the possible provide amodel of the cognitive pattern into which readers organize information in order to interpret it as a story. But the many-worlds interpretation of physics and the possible worlds (PW) model of narrative differ in their conception of the onto- logical status of the multiple worlds: in physics they are all actual, while narrative theory stresses the contrast between actuality and mere possibility. This does not mean that the PW model is incompatible with themany-worlds cosmology proposed by physics: faced with a narrative that presents multiple realities as existing objec- tively, the theory would simply claim that the actual domain is made up of a number of differentworlds and that the distinction actual/nonactual repeats itself within each of these parts.The last section of the essay explores what it takes for a narrative to impose a many-worlds cosmology, distinguishing these narratives from other texts that present contradictory versions of facts and situating them with respect to three types of story common in fantasy and science fiction: the narrative of transworld exploration, the narrative of alternate history, and the time-travel narrative.},

The problem with such definitions is that they cannot distinguish fiction from counterfactual statements, or from the reports of dreams, wishes and fantasies which occur in the context of natural discourse. This paper attempts to capture the difference, as well as the similarities, between fiction and other language uses involving statements about non-existing worlds by comparing their respective behavior in the light of an interpretive principle which will be referred to as the {\textquotedblleft}principle of minimal departure{\textquotedblright}. This principle states that whenever we interpret a message concerning an alternate world, we reconstrue this world as being the closest possible to the reality we know. In the non-factuals of natural discourse the referents of the pronouns I and you are reconstrued as retaining the personality of the actual speaker as fully as possible, but in fiction they are immune to the principle of minimal departure.},

	abstract = {The concept of narrative has been widely invoked by theorists of digital textuality, but the promotion ofwhat is described as the storytelling power of the computer has often relied on shallow metaphors, loose conceptions of narrative, and literary models that ignore the distinctive properties of the digital medium.Twomyths have dominated this theorization.The myth of the Aleph (as I call it) presents the digital text as a finite text that contains an infinite number of stories.Themyth of the Holodeck envisions digital narrative as a virtual environment in which the user becomes a character in a plot similar to those of Victorian novels or Shakespearean tragedies. Both of thesemyths rely on questionable assumptions: that any permutation of a collection of lexias results in a coherent story; that it is aesthetically desirable to be the hero of a story; and that digital narrativity should cover the same range of emotional experiences as literary narrative. Here I argue that digital narrative should emancipate itself from literary models. But I also view narrative as a universal structure that transcends media.This article addresses the question of reconciling the inherent linearity of narrative structures with themultiple paths made possible by the interactive nature of the digital text by distinguishing four forms of interactivity, which result from the cross-classification of two binaries: internal versus external interactivity; and exploratory versus ontological. Each of these categories is shown to favor different narrative themes and different variations of the universal narrative structure.},

Made popular as a concept by Henry Jenkins (2006), transmedial storytelling is the creation of a storyworld through multiple documents belonging to various media. The three fundamental operations of transfictionality{\textemdash}expansion, modification, and transposition{\textemdash}are investigated in terms of their potential for transmedial storytelling. After an analysis of the variety of documents that make up the storyworld of Alpha 0.7 (S{\"u}dwestrundfunk 2010), a German transmedial story system that comprises a TV miniseries, radio plays, fictional web pages, and links to nonfictional texts created independently of the project, the article asks under which conditions an alternate reality game (ARG) could be added to the system without spoiling the experience of those people who limit their exploration of the storyworld to watching the TV show. In turn, the last section asks what kind of stories lend themselves to transmedial projects and why such projects are currently popular.},

	title = {Hacktivism and the {Future} of {Political} {Participation}},
	url = {http://www.alexandrasamuel.com/dissertation/pdfs/Samuel-Hacktivism-frontmatter.pdf},
	abstract = {This dissertation looks at the phenomenon of hacktivism: the marriage of political activism and computer hacking. It defines hacktivism as the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of political ends. These tools include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft, web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, virtual sabotage, and software development. The dissertation uses data from fifty-one interviews in conjunction with additional primary and secondary source material. This data is used to construct a taxonomy of hacktivism, and to apply the taxonomy to three core issues in political participation. Chapter 2 presents a taxonomy of hacktivism defined by variation in hacktivist origins (in the hacker-programmer or artist-activist worlds) and orientations (transgressive or outlaw). The dissertation identifies three distinct types of hacktivism: political cracking, which consists of illegal actions like web site defacements and redirects; performative hacktivism, which consists of legally nebulous actions like virtual sit-ins and web site parodies; and political coding, which consists of political software development. The taxonomy illuminates several key questions in political participation, each examined in a different chapter. Chapter 3 focuses on the role of identity incentives in shaping political participation, and finds a strong correlation between hacktivist origins and the type of hacktivism engaged in. Chapter 4 looks at political coders{\textquoteright} strategy of policy circumvention, which focuses on nullifying rather than changing a targeted law or policy. The success of this strategy depends on political entrepreneurs, low costs of failure, and high political costs of repression. Chapter 5 examines deliberative democrats{\textquoteright} suggestion that the Internet may constitute a new public sphere, friendly to democratic discourse. It suggests that variation in how hacktivists handle speech rights and anonymity challenges proceduralist visions of deliberative democracy. After reflecting on the themes that unite the dissertation, the conclusion reflects on how the post 9/11 political climate has heightened the pressure to erroneously treat hacktivism as cyberterrorism. The author hopes that the rising fortunes of political coding, which is increasingly legitimated by both governments and businesses, will ensure a continued space for hacktivism within the repertoire of political contention.},

Although we view stories as passive and linear, and games as active and nonlinear, during both types of experience, a participant (or guest) is mentally active, and having a linear experience. The way to gauge the quality of the guest's experience is through a system of interest curves, which measure interest over time, and interest is shown to be made of three components: inherent interest, poetry of presentation, and psychological proximity. Finally, this paper introduces the idea of indirect control, which is a method of secretly controlling the desires of a guest, allowing a designer to imbue a non-linear interactive experience with structures typically used in traditional storytelling.},

Video games and digital worlds are promising new modes of association capable of connecting people in a way that passive forms of mass communication are unable to. This essay shows the strength of video games as a medium for associational life by turning to the thought of one of the preeminent philosophers of collective action: Alexis de Tocqueville. Although Tocqueville lived long before the advent of video games, his theory of democracy provides an excellent account of the benefits of civic associations. Among these are teaching enlightened self-interest, creating feelings of efficacy, protecting individuality, and establishing meritocratic norms. Video games are capable of providing each of these goods, making them an effective supplement, though not a replacement, to traditional associational life in an age of increasing fragmentation.},

Moreover, what are the implications of defining this culture in a particular way? While there has been a great deal of ink split on video game culture, the actual definition of the term is often treated as common sense. Unpacking the discourses surrounding "video game culture"" allows us to see the power dynamics involved in attributing certain characteristics to it, as well as naming it "video game culture"" as such. This has implications for how video games are studied and is connected with how culture is studied more broadly. By critically examining how video game culture has been defined in both press and academic articles, this paper illuminates how this definition has limited the study of video games and where it can move.},

	isbn = {0-262-01265-0},
	abstract = {Despite the emergence of computer games as a dominant cultural industry (and the accompanying emergence of computer games as the subject of scholarly research), we know little or nothing about the ethics of computer games. Considerations of the morality of computer games seldom go beyond intermittent portrayals of them in the mass media as training devices for teenage serial killers. In this first scholarly exploration of the subject, Miguel Sicart addresses broader issues about the ethics of games, the ethics of playing the games, and the ethical responsibilities of game designers. He argues that computer games are ethical objects, that computer game players are ethical agents, and that the ethics of computer games should be seen as a complex network of responsibilities and moral duties. Players should not be considered passive amoral creatures; they reflect, relate, and create with ethical minds. The games they play are ethical systems, with rules that create game worlds with values at play. Drawing on concepts from philosophy and game studies, Sicart proposes a framework for analyzing the ethics of computer games as both designed objects and player experiences. After presenting his core theoretical arguments and offering a general theory for understanding computer game ethics, Sicart offers case studies examining single-player games (using Bioshack as an example), multi player games (illustrated by Defcon), and online game worlds (illustrated by World of Warcraft) from an ethical perspective. He explores issues raised by unethical content in computer games and its possible effect on players and offers a synthesis of design theory and ethics that could be used as both analytical tool and inspiration in the creation of ethical game play.},

In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for rep- resenting trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists. In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players. We demon- strate this by performing a close reading of one recent and much-discussed game, The Walking Dead: Season One, analyzing how it incorporates psychological trauma in terms of inter(re)activity, empathy, and complicity.},

When asked about government surveillance and data mining, many people respond by declaring: "I've got nothing to hide." According to the nothing to hide argument, there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate justification to claim that it remain private. The nothing to hide argument and its variants are quite prevalent, and thus are worth addressing. In this essay, Solove critiques the nothing to hide argument and exposes its faulty underpinnings.},

	abstract = {Every Day the Same Dream is a short art game created by the radical game designers Molleindustria, formed and fronted by the Italian artist Paolo Pedercini. The game was produced in 2009 and has since garnered praise within and without the gamer community. This essay pursues a sustained close reading and playing of the game with the goal of providing an interpretation of its complex political meanings. During the exegesis of the game I explore new, interpretive forms of analysis that have arisen around the video game medium (i.e. Espen Aarseth's notion of simulational hermeneutics and Alexander Galloway's concept of gamic allegory). I argue that these forms tend to privilege the understanding of game mechanics and player actions over visual and narrative representations in a game. While these new hermeneutical methods are undeniably useful for uncovering the significance of a particular video game I show how they can be used to marginalize and eclipse interpretive methods focused on gamic representations, thus potentially truncating a game's overall significance or "message." This essay demonstrates that Every Day the Same Dream's political meanings cannot be exhausted by focusing exclusively on game mechanics or player actions, and that a critic needs to pay close attention to the entirety of a game's meaningful modalities{\textemdash}including visual and narrative representation{\textemdash}in order to understand the totality of a game's significance. In the end, while I engage with recent theories of interpretation within game studies, the core of the essay pursues a viable, political reading of Molleindustria's haunting, remarkable dream.},

The objective of this paper is to provide some clarity on the issue of player-centred design by analysing the notions on player in current game design literature. This research also discusses the potentials a multifaceted approach on players can offer for the design of games. The article starts by analysing different approaches on player from abstract ideal player to player profiles and players as co-creators. Later, the benefits of involving players in different phases of design process are examined. As a result the paper produces a grouping of different designer-player relationships that reflect the different design ideologies and traditions. This article contributes to the new field of game design research by producing clarity to some of the inarticulate and ambiguous issues related to the role of players in games and their design. At the same time, the analysis is relevant to the larger understanding of players as game cultural actors.},

To develop and evaluate methods of player research and ways to integrate them into game design processes, we conducted a study with self-documentation sets. To bring playful elements into design of games the tasks were presented in the form of a game. The game box included several different tasks designed to encourage participants to reflect on their relation to games and gaming from various and also unexpected viewpoints. In this paper we focus on the methodological issues, but also present findings on some of the tasks in order to demonstrate what kind of results can be obtained using this kind of approach.},

What makes the game analytically interesting is the creation of a game-world designed to promote a feeling of uncertainty in the player. This article explores the ways in which the ambience of uncertainty is developed within the game. Freud's writing on the uncanny and Kristeva's closely related work on abjection is drawn upon to explore how the game works rhetorically to place the player in an unsettled psychological state. The article argues that the use of the heavily gendered symbolism of the uncanny and the abject is value laden and that consequently we must pay attention to that which we cast out, reject, repress, and destroy in the fictive universe of video game play. The article concludes by suggesting that texts such as F.E.A.R. may resonate with wider uncertainties around the self in late-modern life.},

Our results indicate that animated visual stimuli speed up the course of riddle solving, as the respondents who had visual stimuli were roughly 1.85 times quicker when providing the answer. At the same time, the presence of an animation accompanying the riddle, particularly one which involved the meeting point, seemed to facilitate the correct outcome in the process of riddle solving. We can thus conclude that visuo- spatial stimuli do have an impact on how well or how quickly we mentally run the blend present in the tested riddle},

During the past few decades a third trend has given a new meaning to media fabrication and street cultures: the rise of ludus in the society through maturation of the gamer generations. As more and more activities are perceived as games in the contemporary society, fabricated media expression and performative sports pave the way for a new way of gaming. Born in the junction of playful, ordinary and fabricated, pervasive games toy with conventions and configurations of contemporary media.},

	url = {http://urn.fi/urn:isbn:9789526205410},
	abstract = {Organizations continuously strive to engage customers in the services development process. The social web facilitates this process by enabling novel channels for voluntary feedback-sharing and collaborative interaction through social media and technologically advanced environments. The component parts of these environments are information systems that are linked with social media and designed for large displays to support interactivity. The work performed during this research involved the design and assessment of operational software features for encouraging user engagement through publicly displayed information systems. Drawing upon socio-psychological theories and interconnecting them to the seven social influence design principles listed in the Persuasive Systems Design model, this dissertation examines the role of persuasive software features in altering human behavior with respect to engagement in feedback-sharing and collaborative interaction. The dissertation consists of five quantitative studies, including one Twitter survey (involving 403 respondents) and four experiments with publicly displayed Twitter-based systems (involving 284 users), that successively complement each other to address the main research question: How can social influence design principles persuade people to engage with publicly displayed systems that are integrated with social media? The results of these studies reveal interplay between the design principles and indicate that they have the capacity to improve the persuasiveness of information systems and predict the behavioral intentions of users to engage with such systems in the future. Based on these findings, a framework for studying socially influencing systems (SIS) is proposed. This framework is potentially instrumental in achieving a richer understanding of how to effectively harness social influence for enhanced user engagement through socio-technical environments and for the future development of persuasive information systems},

	abstract = {This study explores the effect of interaction in research on knowledge creation (KC) and its dependence on the conceptualization of a human being. A framework for understanding KC with hermeneutic phenomenology is developed, based on an analysis of recent KC research and key texts on hermeneutic phenomenology. The results obtained indicate that recent KC research still emphasizes the concept of knowledge as an asset inside the human mind, although the interest is in knowing and interpersonal relationships in working communities. Exploration of the use of the effect of interaction in research on KC shows that successful interaction is connected to the ideas of openness, critical thinking, and awareness of past experiences. These elements reflect the general ideas of the hermeneutic tradition without taking into account the historical roots of hermeneutics or questioning the concept of a human being behind them. It is concluded that the hermeneutic circle and phenomenological conceptualization of a human being provide a better defined and more coherent structure for understanding the event of KC as a future-oriented, conscious act of interaction. The frame- work developed offers three fundamental areas for exploration: structure of the interactive event, construction of the human experience in interaction, and modes of being in interaction.},

Subsequently, some possible positive (and negative) impacts of serious games are discussed.

This commercial and cultural success does not exhaust the interest in videogames as a mass art phenomenon because games such as Grand Theft Auto IV and Fallout 3 are structurally radically different from previous forms of mass art. In particular, the ontology of videogames, the nature and identity of their works, and how they are instanced and evaluated is a departure from the familiar mass arts of film and popular music. This paper explores these differences in an attempt to fit videogames into a theory of mass art, but also to provide guidance on the issues of criticism and evaluation that surely follow from their ontological distinctiveness.},

The new field of games studies has generated three somewhat competing models of videogaming that characterize games as new forms of gaming, narratives, and interactive fictions. When treated as necessary and sufficient condition definitions, however, each of the three approaches fails to pick out all and only videogames. In this paper I argue that looking more closely at the formal qualities of definition helps to set out the range of definitional options open to the games theorist. A disjunctive definition of videogaming seems the most appropriate of these definitional options. The disjunctive definition I offer here is motivated by the observation that there is more than one characteristic way of being a videogame.},

Though the language often turns to things like {\textquotedblleft}cheating,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}griefing,{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}disruption of the magic circle,{\textquotedblright} the underlying anxiety about unruliness, transgressiveness, and the emergent nature of these spaces as sites of culture needs to be more fully addressed, as well as the early formulations of the {\textquotedblleft}imagined player{\textquotedblright} that shape the design process.

As in similar cases, early research in this field (which has developed as one of the research vectors of ludology criticism since the late nineties) considers the study of games in the context of existing theories, namely, those of narratology. This situation is perplexing to the extent that while the study of games dates 40 years back, that of narratives is much older, having been inaugurated with Aristotle{\textquoteright}s Poetics, and thus exercising considerable influence in Western culture. However, if there are games in which {\textquoteleft}narrative{\textquoteright} composition is obvious (as is the case, for example, of great part of adventure games), the latter is (clearly) replaced by {\textquoteleft}gameplay{\textquoteright} composition and by the mechanisms of (pure) simulation in other games. For instance, the (imagetic) {\textquoteleft}representation{\textquoteright} of London should not be conflated with the (machinical) {\textquoteleft}simulation{\textquoteright} of Sim City, due to obeying a model that includes {\textquoteleft}rules{\textquoteright} (of behaviour). In effect, the category of ergodic simulation, or {\textquoteleft}gameplay{\textquoteright}, allows for new forms of experience/construction of mediation/immersion to take place. We may thus draw closer, ludically and machinically, to the other side of the mirror/screen (distinct from mirror/paper) into which we, in the wake of Alice, often heteronymically transform ourselves.},

	abstract = {This study explores the cultural and technological developments behind the transition of labels like {\textquoteleft}geek{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}nerd{\textquoteright} from schoolyard insults to sincere terms identity. Though such terms maintain negative connotations to some extent, recent years have seen a growing understanding that {\textquotedblleft}geek is chic{\textquotedblright} as computers become essential to daily life and business, retailers hawk nerd apparel, and Hollywood makes billions on sci-fi, hobbits, and superheroes. Geek Cultures identifies the experiences, concepts, and symbols around which people construct this personal and collective identity. This ethnographic study considers geek culture through multiple sites and through multiple methods, including participant observation at conventions and local events promoted as {\textquotedblleft}geeky{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}nerdy{\textquotedblright}; interviews with fans, gamers, techies, and self-proclaimed outcasts; textual analysis of products produced by and for geeks; and analysis and interaction online through blogs, forums, and email. The findings are organized around four common, sometimes overlapping images and stereotypes: the geek as misfit, genius, fan, and chic. Overall, this project finds that these terms represent a category of identity that predates the recent emergence of {\textquotedblleft}geek chic,{\textquotedblright} and may be more productively understood as interacting with, rather than stemming from, dimensions of identity such as gender and race. The economic import of the internet and the financial successes of high-profile geeks have popularized the idea that nerdy skills can be parlayed into riches and romance, but the real power of communication technologies has been in augmenting the reach and persistent availability of those things that encourage a sense of belonging: socially insulated {\textquotedblleft}safe spaces{\textquotedblright} to engage in (potentially embarrassing) activities; opportunities to remotely coordinate creative projects and social gatherings; and faster and more widespread circulation of symbols {\textendash} from nerdcore hip-hop to geek-sponsored charities {\textendash} confirming the existence of a whole network of individuals with shared values. The emergence of geek culture represents not a sudden fad, but a newly visible dimension of identity that demonstrates how dispersed cultures can be constructed through the integration of media use and social enculturation in everyday life.},

A few prominent experimental games (e.g. Kabul Kaboom, Passage) have demonstrated that when the rhetorical implications of a game's processes and its representational layer are in harmony, worthwhile and coherent messages can be communicated. This paper reports the findings of an extensive analysis of Activision's Kaboom! (1981) [1] that explores its rhetorical design space in the service of developing a general method for the interpretation of simple message-driven games. The paper then shows how the application of this method to even a simple game like Kaboom! reveals an unexpected range of coherent potential messages. The paper concludes with a description of a design process and assistant tool that enables those who are not game designers, or even procedurally literate, to create simple games that present editorial and expressive statements. We see this project as a concrete step forward, both analytically and in enabling production, in the field of procedural rhetoric},

We derive recurrences for L(m,n), the number of legal positions on an m {\texttimes}n board, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm which computes L(m,n) in time O(m 3 n 2 $\lambda$ m ) and space O(m $\lambda$ m ), for some constant $\lambda${\textless} 5.4. An implementation of this algorithm enables us to list L(n,n) for n <= 17. For larger boards, we prove the existence of a base of liberties limL(m,n)------?mn of {\textasciitilde}2.9757341920433572493. Based on a conjecture about vanishing error terms, we derive an asymptotic formula for L(m,n), which is shown to be highly accurate. We also study the Game Tree complexity of Go, proving an upper bound on the number of possible games of (mn) L(m,n) and a lower bound of 22n2/2-O(n) on n{\texttimes}nboards and 22n-1 on 1 {\texttimes}n boards, in addition to exact counts for mn <= 4 and estimates up to mn = 9.

In blending, structure from two or more input mental spaces is projected to a separate "blended" space, which inherits partial structure from the inputs, and has emergent structure of its own. New examples are presented. We show that meaning is not compositional in the usual sense, and that blending operates to produce understandings of composite forms. Formal expression in language is a way of prompting hearer and reader to assemble and develop conceptual constructions, including blends; there is no encoding of concepts into words or decoding of words into concepts. Blending is at work in many areas of cognition and action, including metaphor, counterfactuals, and conceptual change. We point out two fundamental aspects of this general process: cross-space mapping of counterparts, and integration of events.},

Although these studies have extensively documented character portrayals in traditional console and computer video games, there is a lack of content analyses examining character portrayals in the very popular massively multiplayer online game (MMO) genre. Such studies are needed because many characters in MMOs are customized avatars created by users, which may lead to different trends in character demographics. This content analysis examined representations of gender and race among 417 unique characters appearing 1,356 times in 20 hours of recorded content from four popular commercial MMOs, which was generated by five recruited users. Characters tended to be disproportionately male and white, with females and racial minorities appearing much less often. Implications for potential effects on users{\textquoteright} perceptions of social reality are discussed.},

	abstract = {Social bots are automatic or semi-automatic computer programs that mimic humans and/or human behavior in online social networks. Social bots can attack users (targets) in on-line social networks to pursue a variety of latent goals, such as to spread information or to influence targets. Without a deep understanding of the nature of such attacks or the susceptibility of users, the potential of social media as an instrument for facilitating discourse or democratic processes is in jeopardy. In this paper, we study data from the Social Bot Challenge 2011 {\textemdash} an experiment conducted by the WebEcologyProject during 2011 {\textemdash} in which three teams implemented a number of social bots that aimed to influence user behavior on Twitter. Using this data, we aim to develop models to (i) identify susceptible users among a set of targets and (ii) predict users' level of susceptibility. We explore the predictiveness of three different groups of features (network, behavioral and linguistic features) for these tasks. Our results suggest that susceptible users tend to use Twitter for a conversational purpose and tend to be more open and social since they communicate with many different users, use more social words and show more affection than non-susceptible users.},

	abstract = {The popularity of the Twitter social networking site has made it a target for social bots, which use increasingly-complex algorithms to engage users and pretend to be humans. While much research has studied how to identify such bots in the process of spam detection, little research has looked at the other side of the question - detecting users likely to be fooled by bots. In this paper, we examine a dataset consisting of 610 users who were messaged by Twitter bots, and determine which features describing these users were most helpful in predicting whether or not they would interact with the bots (through replies or following the bot). We then use six classifiers to build models for predicting whether a given user will interact with the bot, both using the selected features and using all features. We find that a users' Klout score, friends count, and followers count are most predictive of whether a user will interact with a bot, and that the Random Forest algorithm produces the best classifier, when used in conjunction with one of the better feature ranking algorithms (although poor feature ranking can actually make performance worse than no feature ranking). Overall, these results show promise for helping understand which users are most vulnerable to social bots.},

"Toward a Ludic Architecture" is a pioneering publication, architecturally framing play and games as human practices in and of space. Filling the gap in literature, Steffen P. Walz considers game design theory and practice alongside architectural theory and practice, asking: how are play and games architected? What kind of architecture do they produce and in what way does architecture program play and games? What kind of architecture could be produced by playing and gameplaying? "Toward a Ludic Architecture" is a must-read for analyzing and designing play and games from an architectural standpoint. Such a contribution is particularly applicable in an era when games extend into physical, designed space that is increasingly permeated by devices, sensors, and information networks, allowing for rules and fictions to superimpose our everyday environments. Including a maze-like, episodic, and critical discussion of interweaving "play-grounds," "Toward a Ludic Architecture" is a playful look at the conceptual space of play and games.},

We also discuss what reward systems encourage players to do, and describe how they provide fun even before players receive their rewards. Next, we describe how game reward systems can be used to motivate or change behaviors in the physical world. One of our main suggestions is that players can have fun with both rewards and reward mechanisms{\textemdash}enjoying rewards while reacting to the motivation that such rewards provide. Based on relevant psychological theories, we discuss how reward mechanisms foster intrinsic motivation while giving extrinsic rewards. We think that reward systems and mechanisms in modern digital games provide social meaning for players primarily through motivation, enhanced status within gaming societies, and the use of rewards as social tools.},

	abstract = {This paper re-examines the central thesis of Gadamer's hermeneutics that objectivity is not a suitable ideal for understanding a text, historical event, or cultural phenomenon because there exists no one correct interpretation of such phenomena. Because Gadamer fails to make clear the grounds for this claim, this paper considers three possible arguments. The first, predominant in the literature on Gadamer, is built on the premise that we cannot surpass our historically situated prejudgments. The paper rejects this argument as insufficient. Similarly, the paper rejects a second argument concerning the heuristics of understanding. The paper then articulates a third argument that the object of understanding changes according to the conditions in which it is grasped. The paper appeals to the notion of relational properties to make sense of this claim and to defend the position against two objections: i) that it conflates meaning and significance, and ii) that it is saddled with an indefensible relativism.},

We present a fresh perspective on interactive digital storytelling systems based on table-top role playing games. Table-top games offer players the ability to negotiate and determine outcomes of a game with a referee. The nature of table-top gaming is such that players evolve, grow and maintain a rule set that represents an imaginary world. As such this form of gameplay provides a unique opportunity to study complex interactive storytelling structures under controlled circumstances. Using table- top role playing games as a model, we propose terminology and concepts that are different from the traditional literary or dramaturgical perspectives normally applied to interactive narrative systems.},

@inproceedings{wiemer_computer_2011,
	title = {Computer {History} and the {Movement} of {Business} {Simulations}},
	abstract = {In this paper I explore some aspects of the rise of early business games in the post-war period after the Second World War. For a game to become truth-apt in a scientific sense and able to guide actions in a pragmatic sense it needs coupling to the computer and its technical-mechanical calculatory competence as well as certain types of rationality assigned to it culturally. Regarding this interconnection of games and rationality with the medium computer, three different ways of using computers can be described: First, the idea of the computer functions operationally in administration. With the aid of the computer, many of the corporate management{\textquoteright}s tasks are to be realized in a more rational and less mistake prone way. Secondly, the computer appears simulatorily in this context, by calculating and presenting complex management operations. Following the idea of the cybernetic control circuit the computer as dream constellation promises understanding and manipulability of complex systemic interdependencies. Third, the constellation of the computer acts as a stochastic and probabilistic tool, as a decision making aid in possible situations and for the consequences of future decisions. In early business simulations the company, modeled as a game, is examined and evaluated with the aid of the computer. Thus the business game serves as a metareflection of processes, decisions, strategies and planning within the company (1). The interconnections of rationality and the mediality of computing machines are complex and run parallelly on several levels, as historically the computer not only changes the functionality of a business operationally as an element of rationalization in order to increase efficiency for example in administrative procedures (scientific management), but at the same time is also used on the level of longterm planning, analysis, decision making as well as in schooling and training (decision making).},

We argue that memes are remixed, iterated messages which are rapidly spread by members of participatory digital culture for the purpose of continuing a conversation. We understand that memes develop from emergent memes, which we define as altered or remixed spreadable media. We have adapted and modified Jenkins' term "spreadable media" to refer to original or non-parodied messages. Our analysis benefits from the inclusion of Anthony Giddens' structuration theory to aid in understanding how memes as artifacts of participatory digital culture are created. Our genre development of memes demonstrates the generative capacity for continued memetic transformation and for participation among members of digital culture. We use structuration to position these dynamic components as the core of a duality of structure for Internet memes.},

The basic terminology used stems from Roger Caillois, Michail Bakhtin, James J. Gibson and Ulf Wilhelmsson respectively. The conclusion drawn in the paper is that the environment in games, free play and computer games serve as a playground and stage of purposeful objects that propose affordances and constraints upon the Game Ego manifestation within the game.},

	abstract = {New media technologies have long tapped into social hopes and anxieties, and the turmoil that follows their appearance offers a window into the social tensions of the time. Clashing sets of utopian and dystopian visions have typically resulted in an ambivalent portrayal of such technologies. Video games prove to be no exception. Through a content analysis of media frames in the USA{\textquoteright}s three leading news magazines, the reception and presentation of video-game technology was tracked over a thirty-year period, 1970{\textendash}2000. The resulting patterns tell a story of vilification and partial redemption, owing to the main- stream acceptance of the medium and the aging user base. Fears of the negative effects from the new technology were hypothesized to come from a routine set of conservative worries. The results support this hypothesis. Moreover, the frames surrounding games, especially in the 1980s, reveal many of the key social tensions of the times, primarily those surrounding gender roles, the separation of age and racial groups, and the role of female parents within an increasingly technological society. The place of video games within the larger context of media history, and the social causes of the frames are discussed.},

	abstract = {This article argues, first, that the fundamental structure of the skeptical argument in Kripke's book on Wittgenstein has been seriously misunderstood by recent commenta- tors. Although it focuses particularly on recent commentary by John McDowell, it emphasizes that the basic misunderstandings are widely shared by other commentators. In particular, it argues that, properly construed, Kripke offers a fully coherent reading of PI \#201 and related passages. This is commonly denied, and given as a reason for rejecting Kripke's reading of Wittgenstein's text. Second, it is pretty universally accepted that Kripke's Wittgenstein is a 'non-factualist' about ascriptions of meaning. The article argues that, when Kripke's discussion is rightly understood and the content of 'non-factualism' is clarified, there is an important sense in which the skeptical solution is not committed to non-factualism.},

This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) off-line cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

Second, I interviewed individuals involved with one or more nerd-culture practices. All interviewees evidenced a {\textquotedblleft}scholastic disposition{\textquotedblright} informed by their experiences of schooling. This lay theory of education also influenced how they interpreted their participation in nerd culture. Accounts of their {\textquotedblleft}careers{\textquotedblright} in the subculture, from initial recruitment and deepening engagements to eventual durability or decline, are also examined. Finally, I analyze their experiences of community among nerds. Community- making is a routine feature of their participation but is also subject to external limitations such as time, money, and adult responsibilities. Practitioners{\textquoteright} shared orientations enable them to produce relatively communalized social relationships, even in an individualizing consumer society. The so-called mainstreaming of nerd culture offers opportunities to extend the scope of these relationships but also threatens these communities{\textquoteright} autonomy. This dissertation makes explicit the practical{\textemdash}and therefore morally significant{\textemdash}character of nerd culture, providing a basis for policy- makers, community leaders and ordinary participants to defend these media-oriented practices and their related goods.},

Although literature on motives for playing video and online games is informative, the findings may not reflect the full spectrum of mobile gaming motives due to some unique affordances of mobile games (e.g., mobility). To catch up with the evolving gaming context, a popular mobile game, Poke {\textasciiacute}mon Go, was taken as an example to explore individuals{\textquoteright} mobile gaming motives. A Poke {\textasciiacute}monGoMotive Scale was developed. Seven motives were identified through factor analyses based on survey data from 262 Poke {\textasciiacute}mon Go players (45 percent women; Mage =30.71, standard deviation=7.77): Exercise, Fun, Escapism, Nostalgia, Friendship Maintenance, Relationship Initiation, and Achievement. Both Fun and Friend- ship Maintenance were positive correlates of well-being, whereas Escapism and Nostalgia were negative cor- relates. Relationship Initiation was associated with both better and poorer well-being. Implications of the findings are discussed.},

These online environments could potentially be unique research platforms for the social sciences and clinical therapy, but it is crucial to first establish that social behavior and norms in virtual environments are compara- ble to those in the physical world. In an observational study of Second Life, a virtual community, we collected data from avatars in order to explore whether social norms of gender, interpersonal distance (IPD), and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments even though the modality of movement is entirely different (i.e., via keyboard and mouse as opposed to eyes and legs). Our results showed that established findings of IPD and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments: (1) male-male dyads have larger IPDs than female-female dyads, (2) male-male dyads maintain less eye contact than female-female dyads, and (3) decreases in IPD are compensated with gaze avoidance as predicted by the Equilibrium Theory. We discuss implications for users of online games as well as for social scientists who seek to conduct research in virtual environments.},

However, games education can be surprisingly complex. This book explores ludoliteracy, or the question of what it means to understand games, by looking at the challenges and problems faced by students taking games-related classes. In response to these challenges, this book then describes how online learning environments can be used to support learning about games by helping students get more from their experiences with games, and helping students use what they know to establish deeper understanding. Based on the findings from a series of research studies, Ludoliteracy examines the broader implications for supporting games education.},

A temporal frame is a set of events, along with the temporality induced by the relationships between those events. The authors discuss four common temporal frames: real-world time (events taking place in the physical world), gameworld time (events within the represented gameworld, including events associated with gameplay actions), coordination time (events that coordinate the actions of players and agents), and fictive time (applying sociocultural labels to events, as well as narrated event sequences). They use frames to analyze the real-time/turn-based distinction, various temporal anomalies, and temporal manipulations as a form of gameplay. These discussions illustrate how temporal frames are useful for gaining a more nuanced understanding of temporal phenomena in games. Additionally, their relationist characterization of temporal frames supports analysis and design.},

Therefore the institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: {\textquoteleft}data extraction and analysis,{\textquoteright} {\textquoteleft}new contractual forms due to better monitoring,{\textquoteright} {\textquoteleft}personalization and customization,{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}continuous experiments.{\textquoteright} An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: {\textquoteleft}Big Other.{\textquoteright} It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries long evolution of market capitalism.},

	url = {https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/53226},
	abstract = {The main research problem of this constructive study is, how player{\textquoteright}s learning during
game playing can be supported through game narrative design. When the solutions are
searched within narrative theories, modern game theories, and learning game design
research, the problem turns conceptually challenging. Basically, the challenge stems
from the ambiguous concept of narrative and the diversity of narrative theories. The
academic conversation on learning game design has drawn approaches from various
narrative theories and traditions of screenwriting and creative writing. Hence, the
conversation results fragmental.
Firstly, I consider what kind of narrative definition and conception should be
adopted, so that it best lends itself on applying narrative learning approaches, as well
as, recognizing the novel types of narrative encountered within digital game (design)
context. Secondly, I consider how the player{\textquoteright}s role in game narratives can be
characterized and conceptualized. Finally, the third objective of the study is to
investigate, what guidelines for digital learning game narrative design can be
suggested, applying the constructed concepts and models.
The results contain two models of narrative, the constitutive one, and the game
design -oriented. Within the first-mentioned narrative model, four design areas of
narrative are specified and characterized. In the last-mentioned model, the four design
areas are set to intersect digital game rules. Besides, the concept of co-storyliner is
proposed in order to discuss the position of the player in a game narrative intended by
the designer. When a designer determines links between the narrative design areas and
the game rules, he formulates the grounds and the position from which a player as a
co-storyliner will conduct meaning negotiations and pondering during game playing.
Meaning negotiations and ponderings are something the player must do in order to
pursue and express agency within the game. Hence, when considering player{\textquoteright}s
learning during narrative game playing, I recognize the player{\textquoteright}s meaning negotiations
and ponderings particularly essential.
The study demonstrates, in general, the multidimensional design potential of
game narratives, and especially, the challenging nature of digital narrative design from
the learning game point of view. Several different ways of constructing learning
support can be applied on the four design areas of narrative. Above all, the learning
game narrative designer should piece together the narrative and game rule -related
design decisions as a whole, and concern himself with how the constructed conditions
of meaning negotiations can develop the player regarding the explicitly set learning
objective.},

	abstract = {More and more aspects of our everyday lives are being mediated, augmented, produced and regulated by software-enabled technologies. Software is fundamentally composed of algorithms: sets of defined steps structured to process instructions/data to produce an output. This paper synthesises and extends emerging critical thinking about algorithms and considers how best to research them in practice. Four main arguments are developed. First, there is a pressing need to focus critical and empirical attention on algorithms and the work that they do given their increasing importance in shaping social and economic life. Second, algorithms can be conceived in a number of ways ? technically, computationally, mathematically, politically, culturally, economically, contextually, materially, philosophically, ethically ? but are best understood as being contingent, ontogenetic and performative in nature, and embedded in wider socio-technical assemblages. Third, there are three main challenges that hinder research about algorithms (gaining access to their formulation; they are heterogeneous and embedded in wider systems; their work unfolds contextually and contingently), which require practical and epistemological attention. Fourth, the constitution and work of algorithms can be empirically studied in a number of ways, each of which has strengths and weaknesses that need to be systematically evaluated. Six methodological approaches designed to produce insights into the nature and work of algorithms are critically appraised. It is contended that these methods are best used in combination in order to help overcome epistemological and practical challenges.},

	doi = {10.1353/jnt.2014.0005},
	abstract = {Abstract:My essay joins the contemporary cognitive-narratological debate on whether readers bring to bear on fictional characters the folk psychology that they apply to real people. While arguing for a continuity in readers{\textquoteright} engagement with real and fictional minds, I point out that some literary techniques harness our imaginative, empathic skills to a greater degree than is likely in real life. Specifically, internally focalized texts encourage readers to simulate characters{\textquoteright} experiences in a first-person way, going beyond our usual second- or third-person stance towards other minds. This can create the illusion that we penetrate more deeply into the mental life of characters than we could ever penetrate into that of real people. In the second part of the essay, I use a short story by Julio Cort{\'a}zar as case study for arguing that readers{\textquoteright} first-person involvement with characters can also explain the unsettling effect of texts evoking non-ordinary or impossible mental states and experiences. The thrust of this article is that the narratorial function of {\textquotedblleft}authentication{\textquotedblright} (in Lubom{\'i}r Dole{\v z}el{\textquoteright}s term) is crucial in creating an empathic bond between readers and characters: since in some situations the narrator{\textquoteright}s statements about the mental states of a character cannot be falsified, they are taken to be direct reflections of the character{\textquoteright}s  experience, thereby inviting readers to adopt an empathic mode of engagement.},

We trace generations of peer-to-peer networking, showing that digital piracy is a key component in the development of a political platform that advocates for a set of ideals grounded in collaborative culture, nonhierarchical organization, and a reliance on the network. We assert that this politics expresses itself in a philosophy that was formed together with the development of the state-evading forms of communication that perpetuate unmanageable networks.},

	address = {Moscow},
	title = {Tetris},
	abstract = {Tetris (Russian: ???????, pronounced ['t?tr??s]) is a tile-matching puzzle video game, originally designed and programmed by Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov. It was released on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the USSR in Moscow. He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.
Tetris was the first entertainment software to be exported from the USSR to the US, where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for Commodore 64 and IBM PC. The Tetris game is a popular use of tetrominoes, the four-element special case of polyominoes. Polyominoes have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907, and the name was given by the mathematician Solomon W. Golomb in 1953. However, even the enumeration of pentominoes is dated to antiquity.
The game (or one of its many variants) is available for nearly every video game console and computer operating system, as well as on devices such as graphing calculators, mobile phones, portable media players, PDAs, Network music players and even as an Easter egg on non-media products like oscilloscopes. It has even inspired Tetris serving dishes and been played on the sides of various buildings.
While versions of Tetris were sold for a range of 1980s home computer platforms as well as arcades, it was the hugely successful handheld version for the Game Boy launched in 1989 that established the game as one of the most popular ever. Electronic Gaming Monthly's 100th issue had Tetris in first place as "Greatest Game of All Time". In 2007, Tetris came in second place in IGN's "100 Greatest Video Games of All Time". In January 2010, it was announced that the Tetris franchise had sold more than 170 million copies, approximately 70 million physical copies and over 100 million copies for cell phones, making it the best selling paid-downloaded game of all time. On 14 March 2014, The Tetris Company announced a deal to bring Tetris to two of the latest hardware platforms, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, in partnership with Ubisoft (publishing) and SoMa Play (development), to coincide with the franchise's 30th anniversary.},

	abstract = {Researchers in artificial intelligence and robotics often include a timeline                 stretching into the future in which they predict the convergence between human and                 artificial intelligence. Ray Kurzweil, for example, predicts that in a mere 100                 years humans and intelligent machines will become indistinguishable from one                 another, both ceasing to have permanent corporeal forms. This article argues that                 the one thing we can know for sure about the future is that when it arrives, it will                 be different from what we imagined. The cultural work that predictions like                 Kurzweil{\textquoteright}s perform is less to prognosticate the future than to shape our                 understanding of what it means to be human in the present. Working from the                 {\textquoteleft}sense-think-act{\textquoteright} paradigm foundational to work in artificial                 intelligence and robotics, this article argues that predictions in all three areas                 (sensing, thinking, acting) feed back to affect how the human is envisioned in the                 present. The reconfigurations these predictions bring about are to downplay                 consciousness, embodied cognition, and evolutionary inertia. The article concludes                 by critically evaluating contemporary resistances to the posthuman, especially in                 the writings of Rodney Brooks and Francis Fukuyama.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore the relation between embodiment and cognition from an ecological point of view, which has been given little attention in current studies on embodiment. To begin with, two basic meanings of embodiment are distinguished: the state of being embodied and the act of embodying. This article gives more attention to embodying than to being embodied. Next, the ecological framework to investigate embodiment are presented, with focusing on affordances, tool use, and the body. On this view, it is argued that tools extend action and perception capabilities, which implies that the boundary of the body can be extended beyond the surface of the skin. Then, the empirical studies on perception of affordances, on limb proprioception, and on tool use are outlined. These studies support the idea that the boundary of the body can shift. Finally, the boundary of the body is discussed in reference to perception{\textendash}action systems, suggesting that research on embodiment should pay more attention to the dynamic nature of the body.},

If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity.

	abstract = {This article explores the workings of memes as cultural capital in web-based communities. A grounded analysis of 4chan{\textquoteright}s /b/ board reveals three main formulations of memes as capital, delineating them as subcultural knowledge, unstable equilibriums, and discursive weapons. While the first formulation follows well-documented notions about subcultural knowledge as a basis for boundary work, the latter two focus on the dualities intrinsic to Internet memes. The contradiction between following conventions and supplying innovative content leads to memes{\textquoteright} configuration as unstable equilibriums, triggering constant conflict about their {\textquotedblleft}correct{\textquotedblright} use. Paradoxically, this struggle highlights collective identity, as it keeps shared culture at the center of discussion. Similarly, when memes are used as jabs at the most intense points of arguments, they function simultaneously as signifiers of superior authoritative status and as reminders of common affinity. Thus, the dualities underpinning memes{\textquoteright} structure lead to their performance as contested cultural capital.},

A total of 166 studies from 34 countries (n = 75,269) were included in the analysis. In line with the premise of privacy paradox, privacy concerns did not predict SNS use. However, users concerned about privacy were less likely to use online services and share information and were more likely to utilize privacy protective measures. Except for information sharing, the relationships were comparable for intentions and behavior. Analyses also confirm the role that privacy literacy plays in enhancing use of privacy protective measures. The findings can be generalized across gender, cultural orientation, and national legal systems.},

	abstract = {Prominent critical perspectives on games have adopted ontological framings of the game object, and, linked to this, a privileging of games{\textquoteright} procedural nature, focusing on the game system in itself as the source of meaning. This paper argues that these discourses align with what Jacques Ranci{\`e}re termed the {\textquotedblleft}representative regime{\textquotedblright} of art, and that, instead, much can be gained by adopting the perspective of the {\textquotedblleft}aesthetic regime{\textquotedblright}, which considers the artwork not as an objective system or logos, but as an object of thought for its recipient. Such an understanding allows us to align the philosophical aesthetics of Kant, Ingarden and Iser with preliminary work done in the field of game hermeneutics, with Arsenault and Perron{\textquoteright}s concept of the {\textquotedblleft}magic cycle{\textquotedblright} of game play, and with a phenomenological approach to the game object. This will let us theorize games as aesthetic objects, mental constructs developed by the player as she engages with the unseen game system {\textemdash} which, in turn, allows us to suggests that what may be called the {\textquotedblleft}ludic sublime{\textquotedblright} is a crucial aesthetic moment in the player{\textquoteright}s engagement with a game, defined by the player{\textquoteright}s drive towards mastery of the game coming face-to-face with the impossibility of obtaining complete, direct knowledge of the underlying system. Finally, the concept of the ludic sublime, and its aesthetic implications, will be framed through an analysis of Dark Souls that will demonstrate the aesthetic mechanisms of the ludic sublime in action.},

	abstract = {Game designers and game writers do not have the same understandings, processes, or approaches, and this impedes good practice. This is  not    due to the two modes being so different or incompatible however, as has been claimed now and in earlier narratology and ludology debates. Instead, this article argues that incompatibilities are due more to the schemas of creation: the mental models we are taught and create with, that thwart more integrated practices. We learn to create and think about games in one way, and narrative in another. This siloing is due to a predictable differentiation rhetoric that occurs at the emergence of a new medium: games are not stories, games are not films, VR is not film, X is understood by not being Y. This arbitrariness of difference facilitates a schism in the creator's mind, where elements, roles and industries become irreconcilable. Indeed, whole swathes of wisdom are put to the side in an effort to be recognised as different. When narrative is used in games, then, developers rely on external design grammars, where models from other artforms are imported and shoehorned. There have been attempts to reduce such siloing, but integration cannot happen merely through recognising common elements or traits within a game object. Instead, this article argues that a common understanding can be found through the common factor of the audience or player. To illustrate this point, two successful audience/player-centered approaches from filmmaking and education are outlined, along with a tweaking of the successful MDA framework, providing structures for creatives to avoid the problem of design schema tension and create better projects.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a game design patterns approach in a comparison of the popular Real-Time Strategy (RTS) computer game, Warcraft III by Blizzard, and the popular non-computer strategic board game, Risk by Parker Brothers. The aim is to explore the feasibility of using such an approach to identify differences that would be useful in converting other non-computer based gameplay into computer game designs. While more comparisons are still needed, the differences already identified can be used as high-likelihood candidates in attempts to adapt other non-computer games into successful computer game designs. They may also be useful in attempts to make existing computer-based games or simulations more attractive by better leveraging the strengths of the medium. The paper concludes with a discussion on other uses and insights that could be gained from such comparisons, and future work.},

We introduce five design principles of flexibility: dispensability, live tweakability, tangibility, mobility, and value. Our work demonstrates this approach with the design of an augmented game system composed of playing cards instrumented with near field communication chips and a mobile device with three digital game components: a Card Viewer, a Score Board, and a Turn Keeper. We report on initial user sessions and articulate two emerging challenges for supporting socially negotiated play: (a) solving interaction costs to enable greater flexibility and (b) managing user expectations for the automatic part of a manual{\textendash}automatic system.},

	abstract = {Supporting young children's play in the digital world is a challenging endeavor. Little is known, however, about the parental beliefs and mediation practices regarding children's facilitated play in hybrid (mixed digital/physical) environments and how one can account for this through design. Following a Value Sensitive Design approach, we performed: 1) a conceptual literature investigation, 2) an empirical survey with 1398 parents of child(ren) aged 4-6 years, and 3) a technical investigation on online customer reviews of hybrid playful products for children. Our findings reveal the role of parents' mediation and beliefs in shaping young children's play. We provide designers with guidance to be accountable of the way design properties can foster parental play beliefs and support adult-child interaction. We conclude that young children's facilitated play in hybrid environments is shaped by both the social context in which it is enacted and the affordances provided through design.},

	abstract = {The discussion-board site 4chan has been part of the Internet's dark underbelly since its inception, and recent political events have put it increasingly in the spotlight. In particular, /pol/, the "Politically Incorrect" board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing /pol/ along several axes, using a dataset of over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a general characterization, showing that /pol/ users are well distributed around the world and that 4chan's unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are predominant on /pol/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first measurement study of /pol/, but also insight into online harassment and hate speech trends in social media.},

The authors argue that with the progression of neoliberal capitalism and the explosion of new technologies, a shared logic of social movement politics has emerged. This logic spans from the Zapatistas and the Global Justice Movement to the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East, the Occupy struggles and the most recent wave characterized by Podemos. While each of these waves of contention has a particular character, together they make up a broader epoch of struggle that thrives on multiplicity, emphasized radical participatory democracy, the innovative use of media and the heterogeneity of political struggle.},

Departing from Ernesto Laclau{\textquoteright}s conceptualization of {\textquoteleft}the universal{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}the particular{\textquoteright}, we show how the institutionalization of radical politics (as carried out by The Alternative) entails a move from universality towards particularity. This move, however, comes with the risk of cutting-off supporters who no longer feel represented by the project. We refer to this problem as {\textquoteleft}the problem of particularization{\textquoteright}. In conclusion, we use the analysis to propose a conceptual distinction between radical movements and radical parties: While the former is constituted by an infinite chain of equivalent grievances, the latter is constituted by a prioritized set of differential demands. While both are important, we argue, they must remain distinct in order to preserve the universal spirit of contemporary radical politics},

	abstract = {The analysis of digital activism has so far been dominated by a techno-determinist approach which interprets the logic of activism and its transformation as directly reflecting the properties of the technologies utilised by activists. This line of interpretatoin has been manifested in the popularity acquired by notions as {\textquotedblleft}Twitter protest{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}revolution 2.0{\textquotedblright} in the news media and in academic discourse. Moving beyond this reductionist trend, this article proposes an ideological approach to the study of digital activism and its hisstorical transformation, which can better account for the combination of political, cultural and social factors involved in shaping it. I identity two main waves of digital activism, corresponding not only to two phases of technological development of the internet (the so-called web 1.0 and web 2.0), but also to two different protest waves, the anti-globalisation movement, and the movement of the squares that began in 2011, each with its own dominant ideology. I argue that reflecting the seismic shift in perceptions and attitudes produced by the 2008 crash, and the connected shifts in social movement ideology, digital activism has moved from the margins to the centre, from a countercultural posture to a counterhegemonic ambition. I describe this turn as a transition from cyber-autonomism to cyber-populism as the two defining techno-political orientations of the first and second wave of digital activism. Reflecting the influence of neo-anarchism and autonomism in the anti-globalisation movement cyber-autonomism  saw the Internet as an autonomous space where to construct a countercultural politics outside the mainstream. To the contrary cyber-populism, informed by the populist turn taken by 2011 and post-2011 movements, sees the Internet as a {\textquotedblleft}popular space{\textquotedblright}, which needs to be appropriated by ordinary citizens, turned away from consumption activities and towards the purpose of popular mobilisation against the neoliberal elites. This shift that substantially modifies the way in which activists conceives of and utilise digital media goes a long way towards explaining the differences in digital activism practices, and their contrasting views of the internet as a tool and site of struggle.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To demonstrate the benefits of applying meta ethnography to the synthesis of qualitative research, by means of a worked example., Methods: Four papers about lay meanings of medicines were arbitrarily chosen. Noblit and Hare's seven-step process for conducting a meta ethnography was employed: getting started; deciding what is relevant to the initial interest; reading the studies; determining how the studies are related; translating the studies into one another; synthesising translations; and expressing the synthesis., Results: Six key concepts were identified: adherence/compliance; self-regulation; aversion; alternative coping strategies; sanctions; and selective disclosure. Four second-order interpretations (derived from the chosen papers) were identified, on the basis of which four third-order interpretations (based on the key concepts and second-order interpretations) were constructed. These were all linked together in a line of argument that accounts for patients' medicine-taking behaviour and communication with health professionals in different settings. Third-order interpretations were developed which were not only consistent with the original results but also extended beyond them., Conclusions: It is possible to use meta ethnography to synthesise the results of qualitative research. The worked example has produced middle-range theories in the form of hypotheses that could be tested by other researchers.},

The differences among tabletop roleplaying games, live-action role-playing and digital role-playing games are remarkable, yet they are all considered role-playing games. Hitchens and Drachen (2009) have proposed a definition of roleplaying games comprising of all these types in an attempt to find a definition that could be "commonly accepted". This paper expands upon this definition, exploring its strengths and weaknesses, its relation to digital games and finally suggests an alternative approach. This alternative approach is based on Wittgenstein{\textquoteright}s works on the nature of language, and the hermeneutic tradition's conception of truth. This should be understood as a continuation of the discussion on defining roleplaying games, not as an attempt to end the discussion in some conclusive way. Some general remarks on the problems of exclusive definitions are also presented.},

Kielipeli k{\"a}sitet{\"a}{\"a}n keinoksi ymm{\"a}rt{\"a}{\"a} erilaisten kuvaustapojen suhde toisiinsa. Kuvastavat ovat kesken{\"a}{\"a}n vaihtoehtoisia. Kielipelin k{\"a}sityksi{\"a} ei voida arvioida irrallaan k{\"a}yt{\"o}n kontekstista. Leikki ja peli ovat l{\"a}heisi{\"a} ilmi{\"o}it{\"a}, eik{\"a} niit{\"a} monissa kieliss{\"a} erotella lainkaan toisistaan. Tutkielmassa tarkastellaan ensin leikki{\"a}. Leikki on laaja ilmi{\"o}, joka ei liity vain lasten toimintaan. Leikki liitet{\"a}{\"a}n kommunikaatioon, lajinkehitykselliseen ja yksil{\"o}lliseen hy{\"o}tyyn sek{\"a} kilpailuun. Osa tavoista ymm{\"a}rt{\"a}{\"a} leikki{\"a} soveltuu sellaisenaan pelien ymm{\"a}rt{\"a}miseen; osa osoittaa yhteyksi{\"a} leikin ja pelin v{\"a}lill{\"a}. Pelej{\"a} tarkastellaan kolmen m{\"a}{\"a}ritelm{\"a}n avulla. M{\"a}{\"a}ritelm{\"a}t osoittavat s{\"a}{\"a}nt{\"o}jen, taikapiirin, pelaajan asenteen ja pelin p{\"a}{\"a}m{\"a}{\"a}r{\"a}n olevan t{\"a}rkeit{\"a} pelien ymm{\"a}rt{\"a}misess{\"a}. Pelit perustuvat konstitutiivisille s{\"a}{\"a}nn{\"o}ille. S{\"a}{\"a}nt{\"o}jen tasolla pelit ovat formaaleja systeemej{\"a}. Pelien tutkiminen systeemein{\"a} tarjoaa mahdollisuuden analysoida sek{\"a} pelin osia irrallaan toisistaan ett{\"a} pelin ja ymp{\"a}rist{\"o}n vuorovaikutusta. Taikapiiri on t{\"a}m{\"a}n vuorovaikutuksen rajapinta. Taikapiiriksi kutsutaan sit{\"a} tilallista ja ajallista rajaa, joka erottaa pelin muusta todellisuudesta. Osa peleist{\"a} sis{\"a}lt{\"a}{\"a} vahvoja narratiivisia aineksia. Pelej{\"a} tarkastellaan t{\"a}ss{\"a} tutkielmassa narratiiveina kybertekstien teorian avulla. Kybertekstien teoria on laajennettu narratologinen teoria, joka pyrkii sis{\"a}llytt{\"a}m{\"a}{\"a}n narratologiaan vuorovaikutteiset tekstit, kuten hypertekstit. Pelit heijastavat niit{\"a} ymp{\"a}r{\"o}iv{\"a}n kulttuurin arvoja ja asenteita, mutta niihin sis{\"a}ltyy samalla kritiikin mahdollisuus. On my{\"o}s syyt{\"a} ajatella, ett{\"a} ainakin osa peleist{\"a} voi olla taidetta. Pelin todetaan olevan s{\"a}{\"a}nt{\"o}jen ohjaama, keinotekoinen ja leikkis{\"a} tapa toimia. T{\"a}m{\"a} m{\"a}{\"a}ritelm{\"a} on kuitenkin vain yksi mahdollisista. M{\"a}{\"a}ritelm{\"a}n hy{\"o}dyllisyys riippuu siit{\"a}, millaiseen kielipeliin ja mill{\"a} ehdoilla sit{\"a} pyrit{\"a}{\"a}n soveltamaan.},

	abstract = {This paper looks at three concepts from narratology {\textendash} focalization, granularity and mode of narration {\textendash} and explores how these concepts apply to games. It is shown how these concepts can be used as tools for creating certain meaning effects, understood here as cognitive responses from the player. Games have the usual focalizations (zero, external, internal) available to them, but add an additional hybrid perspective. Sudden changes in focalization can be used to create meaning effects, for example by highlighting the players loss of control over the situation. Games use different types of narrators, with multiple possible modalities. There have already been some exploration of the use of an untrustworthy narrator. Other possible ways to create meaning effects with narrators include omniscient or impossible narrators and changes in how aware the narrator is of their being a narrator. Games have different modes of granularity, ranging from visual and textual to simulative. Choices in granularity {\textendash} what to portray and with how much detail {\textendash} have a great impact on the game experience. Some abstractions are so common as to be taken for granted (hit points), while others are subtle (simulating thirst and hunger), but can change the game experience in profound ways.},

	shorttitle = {Real-time hermeneutics},
	url = {http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-39-6164-0},
	abstract = {Digital games are a relatively new medium. While they have been around for over half a century, they only became a major part of the culture relatively late. Like every other medium before, games also have struggled to find an expressive language of their own. Some of the expressive styles of other media are still relevant for games, but new ones have to be created specifically for videogames.

This dissertation is a study of how ludonarrative videogames, videogames that combine game elements with narrative elements, express and convey meaning. This is done as part of game studies, a multidisciplinary approach to studying games. The purpose is twofold: to build a foundation for better understanding of meaning-making in games, and to provide game designers with tools for analyzing issues related to meaning.

This study uses philosophical tools to analyze meaning in games. The philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer is used to compare the meaning-making in games to the interpretation of works of art. The theory of the interpretive process is based on the idea of the hermeneutic circle. Wittgenstein{\textquoteright}s concept of language-games is used in examining how games should be defined and how their relations to each other should be understood. These philosophical methods are combined with the study of procedurality, narrativity and players.

This study shows that ludonarrative games are procedural systems that are interpreted both during gameplay and as a part of the surrounding cultural context. The result of this interpretation is neither predetermined by the game designer nor fixed during gameplay, but potentially open for endless reinterpretation as players interact with the game in new ways and as the cultural context changes. In order to convey meaning, ludonarrative games can borrow expressive tools from other media, for example by using perspective in the way it is used in cinema.

Additionally, this study provides guidelines for designing meaning. It is shown how meaning can be used as a game mechanic, and how games contain unique ways of expressing things that would be hard to convey in other media.},

For example, hybrid games have often been defined in relation to recent developments in technology. This creates issues in its usage and limitations in thinking. This paper argues that hybrid games should be understood through conceptual metaphors. Hybridity is the blending of different cognitive domains that are not usually associated together. Hybrid games usually blend domains related to games, for example digital and board games, but can blend also other domains. Through this type of thinking, designers can be more open to exploring how their games can be experienced.},

In probabilistic terms, the hypothesis is that prototypicality is a function of the total cue validity of the attributes of items. In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Experiments 2 and 4, subjects listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Experiments 5 and 6 used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories.},
