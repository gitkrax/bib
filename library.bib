abstract = { What kind of subject am I as I stand musing before this installation? I certainly am not the autonomous liberal self who located identity in consciousness and rooted it in my ability, first and foremost, to possess my own body. Rather, as I think about my connection to virtual creatures, I am tempted to fashion myself in their images, seeing myself as a distributed cognitive system comprised of multiple agents running the programs from which consciousness emerges, even though consciousness remains blissfully unaware of them. I am one kind of material embodiment, the virtual creatures are another, but we are connected through dynamic processes that weave us together in a web of jointly articulated cognitive activities. I think, therefore I connect with all the other cognizers in my environment, human and nonhuman, including the dynamic processes that are running right now as you decode these letters and all the dynamic processes that have run in the past and congealed to create this paper, this ink, this old language made of nouns and verbs that I am trying to fashion to new purposes that will allow you to see my body, your body, the bodies of the virtual creatures, not as nouns that enact verbs, but first and foremost as dynamic processes that weave together the embodied materialities of diverse life forms to create richly complex distributed cognitions. That is what virtual creatures can teach us.},

abstract = {People of all ages, but especially children and adolescents, are increasingly exposed to visual stimuli. Typical environmental stimuli that can trigger epileptic seizures in susceptible persons are televisions (TVs), computers, videogames (VGs), discotheque lights, venetian blinds, striped walls, rolling stairs (escalators), striped clothing, and sunlight reflected from snow or the sea or interrupted by trees during a ride in a car or train. Less common stimuli are rotating helicopter blades, disfunctioning fluorescent lighting, welding lights, etc. New potentially provocative devices turn up now and then unexpectedly. During the last decades especially, displays have become increasingly dominant in many of our daily-life activities. We therefore focus mainly on the characteristics of artificial light and on current and future developments in video displays and videogames. Because VG playing has been shown also to have positive effects, a rating system might be developed for provocativeness to inform consumers about the content. It is important that patients with epilepsy be informed adequately about their possible visual sensitivity.},

abstract = {The goal of the project presented in this paper is to enable motor rehabilitation to stroke patients in their home environment and to utilise game enjoyment to achieve frequent training. Stroke patients have an average age above 70 years, which implies that they typically do not belong to a gaming generation. In addition, these patients suffer from motor, and many times cognitive impairments, which make traditional games extremely difficult to use. Nearly all work in this area has been conducted in a clinic environment where it is possible to overcome some of these difficulties by letting professionals assist and guide patients.In this paper, we present the challenges faced, the system itself and the result from a study where five patients were equipped with a game console in their homes for five weeks. The focus of this paper is on analysing the gaming behaviour of patients, which includes the amount of time they spent, the type of games they selected and their comments on the gaming experience. The conclusion from this analysis is that their behaviour resembles that of gamers. They spent significant voluntary time, and it has been possible for patients, with no prior experience of computer games, to enjoy gaming in their homes where they had no professional assistance.},

abstract = {Gender-inclusivity in games has been a much debated issue and despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. Gender-inclusivity in games may support certain features and in turn may even determine the features of applications built based on it. This poses a challenge: although we have good techniques for analyzing, designing and evaluating current games, our techniques for gender-inclusive games are much less formed. This article discusses some unresolved issues concerning gender-inclusivity in games and the gaps in designing a more gender-inclusive game. We present the implications of each issue towards gender-inclusivity in games. In conclusion, we proposed a framework that defines gender-inclusivity in three key components: (1) genre, which indicates the type of game, (2) gameplay, which describes the game behaviour and (3) content, which describes the game content. Some applications of the framework are outlined.},

Therefore, in this paper we examine how the players of the game America\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Army changed their performance, play styles and social positions after one year of game play experience. For the initial investigation, we compare performance measures and play style at the beginning and the end of our survey period. Also, we calculate social network measures, such as centrality measures and clustering measures, to see how the social positions of the players change. After the comparison, we observe that players with one year of experience are more sensitive to communication and have tighter and denser communication networks around them.},

abstract = {To date the most popular and sophisticated types of virtual worlds can be found in the area of video gaming, especially in the genre of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG). Game developers have made great strides in achieving game worlds that look and feel increasingly realistic. However, despite these achievements in the visual realism of virtual game worlds, they are much less sophisticated when it comes to modeling face-to-face interaction. In face-to-face, ordinary social activities are "accountable," that is, people use a variety of kinds of observational information about what others are doing in order to make sense of others\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} actions and to tightly coordinate their own actions with others. Such information includes: (1) the real-time unfolding of turns-at-talk; (2) the observability of embodied activities; and (3) the direction of eye gaze for the purpose of gesturing. But despite the fact that today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s games provide virtual bodies, or "avatars," for players to control, these avatars display much less information about players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} current state than real bodies do. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the lack of each type of information on players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} ability to tightly coordinate their activities and offer guidelines for improving coordination and, ultimately, the players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} social experience.},

parts, including a wide range of different game aspects (e.g., storyline, multi-player options), and
player experiences (e.g., immersion, flow). Previous experimental studies in psychology, examining the
differential effects of violent versus non-violent videogames have been methodologically limited when
choosing suitable videogames between experimental conditions. This paper outlines a methodological
approach for identifying potential differences between videogames. This can be obtained by using
regular gamers to rate videogames on numerous game aspects and player experiences. This method
can effectively initialise the research process when selecting games, to ensure control of games
between experimental conditions. This paper acknowledges the complexity of games, and aims to
inform future research of the effectiveness of this method within the pilot testing stage of the research
process.},

abstract = {The technology acceptance model (TAM) is one of the most widely used models of information technology (IT) adoption. According to TAM, IT adoption is influenced by two perceptions: usefulness and ease of use. In this study, we extend TAM to the mobile commerce context. We categorize the tasks performed on wireless handheld devices into three categories: (1) general tasks that do not involve transactions and gaming, (2) gaming tasks, and (3) transactional tasks. We propose a unified conceptual model for wireless technology adoption. In this model, task type moderates the effects of four possible determinants: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived playfulness, and perceived security. We postulate that, under the mobile context, user intention to perform general tasks that do not involve transactions and gaming is influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, user intention to play games is affected by perceived playfulness, and user intention transact is influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived security. A survey was conducted to collect data about user perception of 12 tasks that could be performed on wireless handheld devices and user intention to use wireless technology. Multiple regression analyses supported the proposed research model.},

Teachers cannot be expected to embrace digital games as a tool for learning unless they have a sound understanding of the potential as well as the limitations, and are confident in their ability to use games effectively to enhance learning. The course was designed as an introduction to digital games and gaming for instruction and learning. In it, students explored the theories, the possibilities, considerations and constraints related to the design of instructional games, and the use of learning and commercial entertainment games in classroom and out-of-class settings. The design of the course, along with the rationales, will be outlined and participant reaction will be profiled. Suggestions for future course designs are described, as well as key elements crucial for teacher preparation. Ultimately, the success of digital games as a medium for learning depends to a large extent on the abilities of new and practicing teachers to take full advantage of this medium.},

Violent content has been at the top of the agenda even though aggression and hostility have been identified as a part of competitive gaming situations. The role of the opponent in this process has been largely overlooked. We examined the difference in frustration and aggression in game play after users encountered the computer as opponent and a proximate person as opponent using the same CD-ROM version of Monopoly. We found that users experienced higher levels of aggressive feelings after playing the computer than after playing a stranger face-to-face.

of Salzburg, students were able to take control of their own learning, and at the same time were exposed to cultural and linguistic realia that are often not present in other types of language games. In playing the game, students reported an improvement in their listening skills, and they
also noted that the experience was beneficial for vocabulary learning, pronunciation, general fluency, and improving reading skills. Surveys and direct observation of student game play offer
insights into attitudes towards personal use of games, the value of educational games for teaching language and impact of different testing environments on the success of playing a game.
Examining the recorded paths taken through this world by students during the game, space syntax research offers some interesting perspective insights into strategies game players employ when looking for the correct path through an urban space. In fact, isovist and axial maps may be helpful in predicting the first line of action taken by game players as they navigate through a virtual world with no verbal clues.},

A framework for using game engines for information visualisation is presented together with an analysis of how the capabilities and constraints of a game engine influence the mapping of data into graphical representations and the interaction with it. Based on this research a source code comprehension tool was implemented using the Quake 3 computer game engine. It was found that game engines can be a good basis for an information visualisation tool, provided that the visualisations and interactions required meet certain criteria, mainly that the visualisation can be represented in terms of a limited number of discrete, interactive, and physical entities placed in a static 3-dimensional world of limited size. <br />

The author offers a new approach to games that stresses them as characterized by process. Games, the author argues, are domains of contrived contingency, capable of generating emergent practices and interpretations, and are intimately connected with everyday life to a degree heretofore poorly understood. This approach is both consistent with a range of existing social theory and avoids many of the limitations that have characterized much games scholarship to date, in particular its tendency toward unsustainable formalism and exceptionalism. Rather than seeing gaming as a subset of play, and therefore as an activity that is inherently separable, safe, and pleasurable, the author offers a pragmatic rethinking of games as social artifacts in their own right that are always in the process of becoming. This view both better accords with the experience of games by participants cross-culturally and bears the weight of the new questions being asked about games and about society.},

abstract = {During the past two decades, the popularity of computer and video games has prompted games to become a source of study for educational researchers and instructional designers investigating how various aspects of game design might be appropriated, borrowed, and re-purposed for the design of educational materials. The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of how the structure in massively multiple online role-playing games (MMORPGs) might inform the design of interactive learning and game-based learning environments by looking at the elements which support intrinsic motivation. Specifically, this analysis presents (a) an overview of the two primary elements in MMORPGs game design: character design and narrative environment, (b) a discussion of intrinsic motivation in character role-playing, (c) a discussion of intrinsic motivational supports and cognitive support of the narrative structure of small quests, and (d) a discussion of how the narrative structure of MMORPGs might foster learning in various types of knowledge.

The OWS case study demonstrates how the rapid digital circulation of texts allows protestors to quickly build a geographically dispersed, networked counterpublic that can articulate a critique of power outside of the parameters of mainstream media. Furthermore, we find that the relay of pre-existing material was perceived to be just as meaningful a form of participation as drafting original compositions. By including these forwarding activities in their online efforts, these Twitter users worked to expand the circulation of information building and sustaining an OWS counterpublic. However, dependence on this external platform leaves protestors vulnerable to restrictions on their ability to communicate, as well as to unwanted surveillance from potentially hostile authorities.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model, called Scene-Driver, for the re-use of film and television material. We begin by exploring general issues surrounding the ways in which content can be sub-divided into meaningful units for re-use and how criteria might then be applied to the selection and ordering of these units. We also identify and discuss the different means by which a user might interact with the content to create novel and engaging experiences. The Scene-Driver model has been instantiated using content from an animated children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s television series called Tiny Planets, which is aimed at children of 5-7-year old. This type of material, being story-based itself,]ends itself particularly well to the application of narrative constraints to scene reordering, to provide coherence to the experience of interacting with the content. We propose an interactive narrative-driven game architecture, in which a user generates novel narratives from existing content by placing "domino" like tiles. These tiles act as "glue" between scenes and each the choice dictates certain properties of the next scene to be shown within a game. There are three different game-types, based on three different ways in which tiles can be matched to scenes. We introduce algorithms for generating legal tile-sets for each of these three game-types, which can be extended to include narrative constraints. This ensures that all novel orderings adhere to a minimum narrative plan, which has been identified based on analysis of the Tiny Planets series and on narrative theories. We also suggest ways in which basic narratives can be enhanced by the inclusion of directorial techniques and by the use of more complex plot structures. In our evaluation studies with children in the target age-range, our game compared favourably with other games that the children enjoyed playing.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the interaction forms of a contemporary multiplayer game in order to offer implications for multiplayer game design. The motivation for the research originates from the fact that the lack of intuitive and perceivable interaction cues is one of the distinctive features separating networked game settings from face-to-face encounters. The analysis of the interaction forms in multiplayer game sessions indicates that the players can use various forms of non- verbal communication and perceivable actions to reduce communication difficulties. However, players still tend to communicate outside the game system and they try to overcome the limitations of the systems by inventing various imaginative ways to communicate, co-ordinate and co -operate. The findings of this study support the earlier research conducted within the field. However, the improvements in game technologies have been able to slightly reduce the problems of net gaming. Nevertheless, game designers need to take versatile interaction form support into account when designing and developing multiplayer games. It is mainly perceivable and holistic manifestations of interaction that enable players to fully collaborate and cooperate in networked game settings.},

In this paper, we present a game prototype that enables children travelling in the back seat of a car to enjoy a narrated experience where game play combines with the experience of traveling through the road network. The prototype is designed to provide, what we refer to as a believable environment. We sug-gest four design characteristics to provide a persuasive inclusion of a journey into a pervasive game. First, the story should refer to geographical objects with their everyday meaning. Second, the game needs to scale over vast areas. Third, the application should provide sequential storytelling to make it fit with the journey ex-perience, and finally it should provide interaction support where players can engage in gameplay and interact with the computer in various ways at the same time as they are looking out of the car window. We describe how these requirements have been imple-mented in the prototype and present an initial performance test.

A human-verified metric of interest (i.e. player entertainment in real-time) for predator/prey games and a neuro-evolution on-line learning (i.e. during play) approach have already been reported in the literature to serve this purpose. In this paper, an alternative quantitative approach to entertainment modeling based on psychological studies in the field of computer games is introduced and a comparative study of the two approaches is presented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy ANNs are used to model player satisfaction (interest) in real-time and investigate quantitatively how the qualitative factors of challenge and curiosity contribute to human entertainment. We demonstrate that appropriate non-extreme levels of challenge and curiosity generate high values of entertainment and we discuss the extensibility of the approach to other genres of digital entertainment and edutainment.},

Thus in this paper, we propose a conversational locomotion model for virtual characters. We constructed a conversational locomotion network for a virtual environment.

The character also locally adjusts its position so that it does not limit the referenced object from the user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s sight.

abstract = {Modern video games represent highly advanced virtual reality simulations and often contain virtual violence. In a significant amount of young males, playing video games is a quotidian activity, making it an almost natural behavior. Recordings of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during gameplay may reflect neuronal correlates of real-life behavior. We recorded 13 experienced gamers (18-26 years; average 14 hrs/week playing) while playing a violent first-person shooter game (a violent computer game played in self-perspective) by means of distortion and dephasing reduced fMRI (3 T; single-shot triple-echo echo-planar imaging [EPI]). Content analysis of the video and sound with 100 ms time resolution achieved relevant behavioral variables. These variables explained significant signal variance across large distributed networks. Occurrence of violent scenes revealed significant neuronal correlates in an event-related design. Activation of dorsal and deactivation of rostral anterior cingulate and amygdala characterized the mid-frontal pattern related to virtual violence. Statistics and effect sizes can be considered large at these areas. Optimized imaging strategies allowed for single-subject and for single-trial analysis with good image quality at basal brain structures. We propose that virtual environments can be used to study neuronal processes involved in semi-naturalistic behavior as determined by content analysis. Importantly, the activation pattern reflects brain-environment interactions rather than stimulus responses as observed in classical experimental designs. We relate our findings to the general discussion on social effects of playing first-person shooter games.},

Due to the difference between traditional and wireless networks, in particular in terms of available bandwidth and network structure, the concepts used for supporting real-time applications in both networks are different. This paper gives an overview of the key technical challenges that are fundamental and need to be solved in order to easily support real-time applications in wireless and mobile environments. In a first step, issues related to service provisioning in mobile networks are discussed. This is followed by a look at the Quality of Service supported by wireless networks and possible techniques for improving it. Finally, concepts for securing the communication between the users of real-time applications in wireless and mobile networks are presented. For each of these issues, we provide a detailed analysis and an overview of the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we illustrate the main points using distributed online games as an example.},

What effect does this have on gameplay? A longitudinal study of a multiplayer team game is presented. Our analysis looks at how the players (all adults) used VoIP to resource their interaction with each other in the virtual game world. We found that VoIP represents talk in ways that differ both to face-to-face communication and to text-mediated communications. VoIP audio representations interact with, and mediate, the graphical materials of the game world in distinctive and unusual ways which can generate problems to be overcome for players. But they also provide clear benefits for learning and coordination, which are found neither in face-to-face or text communication. We conclude by considering the implications of these problems and benefits for design.},

abstract = {In the paper we shall argue for the potential of serious games for teaching and learning languages online. The paper builds on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007-2010), in which an online game-based platform for teaching and learning English (www.Mingoville.com) has been studied in the context of teaching and learning English in Danish primary schools. The initial research process - which was based on an analysis of the platform as well as interviews with platform developers - suggested that one of the challenges of developing a design for serious games in language education consists of renegotiating the serious games genre to balance drill-based exercises with contextualised simulations that involve fruitful thinking, real language interaction and student engagement. One hypothesis of the project is, following the initial research and drawing on previous research in the field, that the process of designing serious games for CALL may significantly benefit from involving children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s own experiences with using languages (primarily English) online for gaming and interacting. This to some extent involves transcending the dichotomy of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}serious\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}pleasurable\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} learning found in the discourse on learning with games inside and outside schools.},

In this paper the player character of Silent Hill 3 is analyzed using presented categorization. This paper shows that the classification is a useful analytic tool, but it needs to be developed further to include belongings and space as elements describing a player character.

abstract = {Interactive virtual environments are becoming increasingly popular for their utility in virtual training, distributed decision-making and collaborative environments. Some of these applications rely on a scenario that is revealed to the user as he/she interacts with synthetic objects and characters that inhabit virtual worlds. The development and authoring of interactive dynamic scenarios is often hard and difficult to accomplish using current techniques. Many interactive scenario developers use decision trees, which yield very limiting and unfulfilling training experiences, because they do not stimulate learning or thinking beyond the scripted paths. Some researchers proposed plan-based interactive narrative architectures, which, although superior to decision trees, do not scale and do not address user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s goals and intentions, yielding inflexible scenarios that do not adapt suitably to players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} goals or behaviors. In this paper, we propose a dynamic scenario architecture that aims at enhancing scalability and reuse by using a multi-agent layered problem solving technique. Additionally, the interactive scenario architecture will automatically adapt to users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} goals by integrating a user model and a user monitoring technique.

abstract = {MMORPGs have become extremely popular among network gamers. Despite their success, one of MMORPG\&\#39;s greatest challenges is the increasing use of game bots, i.e., auto-playing game clients. The use of game bots is considered unsportsmanlike and is therefore forbidden. To keep games in order, game police, played by actual human players, often patrol game zones and question suspicious players. This practice, however, is labor-intensive and ineffective. To address this problem, we analyze the traffic generated by human players vs. game bots and propose solutions to automatically identify game bots.Taking Ragnarok Online, one of the most popular MMOGs, as our subject, we study the traffic generated by mainstream game bots and human players. We find that their traffic is distinguishable by: 1) the regularity in the release time of client commands, 2) the trend and magnitude of traffic burstiness in multiple time scales, and 3) the sensitivity to network conditions. We propose four strategies and two integrated schemes to identify bots. For our data sets, the conservative scheme completely avoids making false accusations against bona fide players, while the progressive scheme tracks game bots down more aggressively. Finally, we show that the proposed methods are generalizable to other games and robust against counter-measures from bot developers.

abstract = {Objectives. To explore the association between early computer experience (both accessibility and frequency of use) and cognitive and psychomotor development among young children. Methods. The participants were 122 preschool children enrolled in a rural county Head Start program in the United States during 2001-2002. The following tests were administered to the children: the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test; the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts, Third Edition Preschool; the Test of Gross Motor Development, Second Edition; and a short form of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-Revised. Information pertaining to family characteristics and children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s early computer experience was collected from parents. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association between early computer experience and cognitive and motor development. Results. Of the participating children, 53\% had a computer at home. Among families who had a computer, 83\% had children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s software on the computer. According to parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} reports, 29\% of these children played on the home computer on a daily basis, and an additional 44\% of the children played on the computer at least weekly. Of those families who did not have a home computer, 49\% reported that their children had access to a computer somewhere outside home. Among these children, 10\% had daily access to the computer and 33\% had weekly access. The presence of a computer in the home was significantly associated with the family\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s income and the educational attainment of the parents. There was no gender difference in computer accessibility and frequency use among the participating children. Children who had access to a computer performed better on measures of school readiness and cognitive development, controlling for children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s developmental stage and family socioeconomic status. The data in the current study did not suggest a relationship between computer experience and visual motor or gross motor skills among the participating children. Conclusion. The findings in the present study suggest that early computer exposure before or during the preschool years is associated with development of preschool concepts and cognition among young children. However, frequency of use did not reveal such a relationship; neither did the ownership of other child electronic or video games in the household.},

Unfortunately not all genres of digital games have taken advantage of the new technology and game design knowledge now available. Commercial and educational games have evolved in different ways. For instance, while the commercial game market has experienced continuous growth, the educational game market is almost non-existent. Users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} preference for commercial games indicates that people have different motivations for playing commercial games and for playing educational games. Motivation theories provide a framework to study how users engage with these games, so that designers can apply the best features of both computer applications to create powerful learning tools.},

abstract = { Talking about games refers in today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s world often to the play of audio-visual computer games. Since their first introduction in the 1960s, computer games have evolved in many ways and are today one of the fastest growing industries. Besides the classic visual games, another niche has emerged over the last decade: audio-only computer games. The main difference to conventional games is that these games can only be played and perceived through sound and acoustics. Although, initially developed by and for the visually impaired community, these games posses huge potentials for mobile (transportable) gaming and can be enjoyed by all hearing. In this work we present an overview of audio-only games, and discuss the methods and techniques to play and design such auditory worlds. We further explore the evolved genres and address the advantages, as well as the limitations of audio based gaming. Our work is motivated by our own research in this area and the development of a framework, which allows an easy design and setup of audio-only computer games.},

abstract = {In a recent survey of over 319,223 students, 25,544 teachers, 19,726 parents and 3,263 school leaders in the United States, Project Tomorrow (2008) reports that more than half of students in grades 3 through 12 believe games would help them learn, and average 8-10 hours per week playing games. Only 3\% of elementary school students say they do not play games of any kind. While only 11\% of teachers reported that they already were using video games in class, many teachers feel that games could increase student engagement, address different learning styles, and teach critical thinking skills. Over half of the teachers surveyed were interested in learning more about integrating gaming technologies, with only 6\% of teachers saying that they saw no value in exploring games within education (Project Tomorrow, 2008, p. 4). These figured indicate a huge potential for Serious Games in educational contexts.

Games can create a rich user experience (UX) for game players while presenting opportunities to use meta-cognitive skills. Research suggests that video games can provide a rich experience while providing game players the ability to navigate a virtual world, in which complex decision making and the management of complex issues might resemble the cognitive processes that they would employ in the real world (Ducheneaut, Yee, Nickell, \& Moore, 2006; FAS, 2006; Squire, 2005; Stokes, 2005). Games are engaging, because they: \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}give us enjoyment and pleasure; give us intense and passionate involvement; give us structure; give us motivation; give us doing; give us flow; give us learning; give us ego gratification; give us adrenaline; they spark our creativity; give us social groups; and give us emotion\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} (Prensky, 2001, p. 144).

Much of the existing research on Serious Games focuses on general introductions to gaming and their application in a classroom, broad case studies, and learning outcomes associated with using games in the classroom. There exists an opportunity for a thorough investigation into the actual uses of games in an educational setting, focusing on the collaborative learning process and how students make use of both cognitive and social affordances of gaming. Affordances can be used to focus on what opportunities are offered (afforded) to an actor by the environment (use of games in educational contexts) being studied. The term cognitive affordance is used to discuss a potential for cognitive action; and social affordance to describe a potential for social action. In this paper both the use of the video game interface and peer group cultures (Kirriemuir \& McFarlane, 2004) are foci of analysis. This descriptive analysis presented in this chapter can inform game design by improving game content and the game interface, as well as aiding in the design of content to achieve meaningful, serious outcomes. 

An open-ended, emergent approach drawing from ethnomethodology and grounded theory will be presented. The descriptive analysis to be described will enable game researchers to conduct qualitative, inductive case studies of game play, digging into actual uses of games in Serious contexts. An emphasis on conducting open-ended, inductive experiments is extremely useful for investigating new situations where a theory-driven approach (deductive hypothesis testing) may not be appropriate, as the method is open-ended and allows participants to describe what they feel is most relevant, rather than the researcher (and his hypotheses) predetermining what is most important.

Several influences are described, drawing from the fields of ethnomethodology, grounded theory, and usability research. While strict adherence to these fields of study is not followed, many features of these fields provide inspiration for investigating what occurs during collaborative gameplay. The hybrid method presented can assist researchers in discovering what is happening on a moment-by-moment basis as video games are played, and will guide researchers in finding patterns during game play to abstract patterns in gamer behavior. These inductively-generated hypotheses can be used to test highly relevant aspects such as a video game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s usability or ability to create an engaging learning experience.

Following, influential theory will be presented that helps to form the basis for the later described hybrid, qualitative, inductive methodology. Samples of collected data will be presented, in the form of transcriptions of video recorded collaborative game play. The presented transcripts are from a study within an educational context, where analysis focused on learning; however, the method presented could be applicable to other \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}serious\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} contexts where meaningful outcomes are expected.},

abstract = {This article presents evidence for the reliability and construct validity of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Conceptually, apathy is defined as lack of motivation not attributable to diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. Operationally, the AES treats apathy as a psychological dimension defined by simultaneous deficits in the overt behavioral, cognitive, and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior. Three versions of the AES (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated for 123 subjects, ages 53-85, meeting research criteria for right or left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s disease, major depression, or well elderly control. Multiple forms of reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater) were satisfactory. Several types of validity evidence are presented for each version of the scale, including the following: ability of the AES to discriminate between groups according to mean levels of apathy, discriminability of apathy ratings from standard measures of depression and anxiety, convergent validity between the three versions of the scale, and predictive validity measures derived from observing subjects\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} play with novelty toys and videogames. Guidelines for the administration of the AES are presented, along with suggestions for potential applications of the scale to clinical and research questions.},

Everyone can easily contribute to the development of Moodle with plug-ins, activity modules, blocks and so on. The most used contribution method is activity modules. Moodle has a list of activities by default (forums, quizzes, assignments, etc.). Teachers can use these activities in their classroom to support lessons. But sometimes default activities do not meet the needs of teachers. Therefore, activity module development can be important for efficient use of Moodle in some circumstances. In this study, Moodle infrastructure and development steps of a sample activity module, EduGame, will be explained in a step by step manner. EduGame activity module is a tool to integrate educational flash games into the Moodle. It also saves the game points of students into the Moodle database. Educational computer games are great ways for teachers to pique children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s interest in the learning process. So integrating educational computer games to Moodle can be crucial for computer game based learning.},

This article builds on previous work in cultural, new media, and game studies to introduce a new approach to productive play, the promise of play. This approach analyzes games as sites of cultural production in times of increased transnational mediation and speaks to the formation of identity across places. The authors ground their explorations in findings from ethnographic research on gaming in urban China. The spread of Internet access and increasing popularity of digital entertainment in China has been used as an indicator of social change and economic progress shaped by global flows. It has also been described as being limited by local forces such as tight information control. As such, gaming technologies in China are ideal to ask broader questions about digital media as sites of production at the intersection of local contingencies and transnational developments.},

abstract = {The aims of this research were to describe Finnish adolescents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} different motives for digital game playing, and to examine relations between digital game playing and parent-child communication, school performance, sleeping habits, and perceived health. A questionnaire was used to assess a nationwide postal sample of 12-18-year-old Finns (6761 respondents, response rate 69\%) in winter 2003. Among respondents, 4085 adolescents played digital games and answered questions on digital game motives. Two main motives emerged: instrumental (learn new things and procedures, have a common topic for conversation, use and develop game playing skills, experience different roles/worlds) and ritualized (pastime, entertainment; recover, relax; escape everyday life, forget worries). The importance of all motives increased for participants with longer playing times. Instrumental motives were more important to boys and younger respondents. They were associated with earlier bedtime, worse perceived health, better mother communication, and better school grades, but only among boys. The importance of ritualized motives increased with age and was related to better school performance, worse sleeping habits, and worse perceived health in both sexes. Digital games seem to have the same basic functions as media in serving adolescents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} mood management and stimulation seeking. Among boys, gaming is part of the male socio-cultural communication context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Students attending at distant sites were more likely than on-campus students to use both e-mail and the course listserv. Students used the technology more often for practical reasons than for academic enrichment. At the end of the term they reported increased competence in using CMC and expressed positive opinions about these technological supports. CMC presents a partial remedy for the real and perceived isolation of students taking classes at distant sites. It does not, however, automatically augment learning. },

We report the results of the first year 24 h personal magnetic field monitoring for 356 US and Canadian children by time weighted average TWA and alternative exposure metrics. The mean TWA of 0.12 muT was similar to earlier personal exposure studies involving children. A high correlation was found between 24 h TVA and alternative metrics: 12 h day TWA, 12 night TWA, geometric mean, 95th percentile value, percentage time over 0.2 and 0.3 muT, and an estimate of field stability (Constant Field Metric). Two measures of field intermittency, rate of chance metric (RCM) and standardized rate of change metric (RCMS), were not highly correlated with TWA. The strongest predictor of TWA was location of residence, with highest TWAs associated with urban areas. Residence in an apartment, lower paternal educational level, and residential mobility were also associated with higher TWAs. There were no significant differences in the appliance use patterns of children with higher TWA values. Children with the highest field intermittency (high RCM) were more likely to sit within 3 feet of a video game attached to the TV. Our results suggest that 24 h TWA is a representative metric for certain patterns of exposure, but is not highly correlated with two metrics that estimate field intermittency.},

Results indicated that student experiences in the game mode showed increased alertness, increased feelings of being active, increased feelings of involvement and an increased perception of challenge. Flow characteristics revealed boredom during standard lectures but anxiety and flow during game modes. Finally, some evidence of improved attainment was evident. By using contemporary interactive approaches such as computer games, student learning experiences and attainment may be improved. Some practical issues of implementing games are also discussed.},

The idea is to apply pervasive computing technology - which embeds computers in real-world, everyday environments - to games. By bringing gaming back to natural, social interaction spaces, pervasive gaming aims to overcome some restrictions of conventional computer games: Players are no longer tied to computer screens and human-human interaction is not constrained by graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which is a crucial aspect of traditional non-computer games. Our approach to pervasive gaming also builds on tangible user interfaces (TUIs) where players interact with the game environment by physically grasping and moving real-world objects. In this paper, we propose a simple and cost-effective, but efficient and powerful approach to tangible and pervasive gaming based on Phidgets. The framework, as well as two example games, have been developed as part of a Game Design course at the ISNM.},

abstract = {This paper uses two Asian case studies to illustrate the issues that developers of virtual worlds should address as they mature. The Korean case emphasizes the phenomenon of item trading. This involves emergent markets linking real world currency to items existing on company servers. The practice has resulted in controversial and unresolved legal issues. Companies such as ItemBay have grown to take advantage of these opportunities. The Chinese case emphasizes the transformation of business models over time as well as community control. The paper discusses feedback effects between broadband adoption and online games as well as issues such as Waigua, private servers, virtual property trade, and developer control. The experience of these countries shows that initial technical challenges for business models were overcome but new ones are beginning to emerge as the industry evolves. The new environment requires a change in the assumptions under which the game industry has operated.},

abstract = {This paper describes the effect of attitudes to new technology on user experience in two different digital games. User experience is measured by using a framework which includes perceptual-attentive, cognitive-emotional and motivational constructs. They form four experiential dimensions; Physical presence, Emotional involvement, Situational involvement and Performance competence. Attitudes to new technology were measured by asking from the subjects how interested in new technology they were. Two types of computer games were played in two different displays. The results show the dependence of experiential dimensions on subjects attitudes towards new technology. Attitudes to new technology modify the expectations and beliefs, hence the motivation of the user. The results have relevance especially when considering the optimal target group of marketing computer games.},

This new range of applications cannot tolerate poor network performance (high delays or low available bandwidth) or network instability (periods of loss or variation in delay or available bandwidth). Unfortunately, routine events such as equipment failures or planned maintenance cause routing changes, which may lead to transient service disruptions or persistent performance problems. Operators of ISP networks are faced with the challenge of minimizing routing disruptions using current routing technology, which offers little control. In this article we discuss routing disruptions from an ISP perspective. First, we describe the causes and effects of routing changes. Then we provide a set of network design guidelines and operational practices that network operators can use to reduce the impact of routing changes in their network.},

abstract = {Machinima are computer-animated films shot within video games that reveal possibilities and pitfalls in the growing convergence of cinema and video games. By satirically dramatizing the inner lives of video game characters, the machinima films Deviation and Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles undercut the cycle of combat and death that impels first-person shooters. Performed through standard avatars provided in the online multiplayer video game Counter-Strike, Deviation imagines the existential horror of actually living one\&\#39;s life within the bloody, militaristic, single-goal-driven universe of a first-person shooter game. Although it celebrates the radical possibility of filmmaking distributed across a network of remote collaborators who meet in the virtual space of an online game, Deviation soundly condemns the pointlessness of video-game violence and displays no enthusiasm for game play. Deviation\&\#39;s serious-minded critique of repetition and futility within the gaming world is indebted for its \&quot;Why are we here\&quot; theme, if not its tone, to the best-known machinima work to date, the ongoing comedy series Red vs. Blue, which, unlike Deviation, remains unabashedly steeped in the lowbrow world of game culture.

Children were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 conditions: (1) the healthier advergame condition, (2) the less healthy advergame condition, or (3) the control condition.Setting: Urban public elementary schools.Participants: Thirty low-income, African American children aged 9 to 10 years.Main Exposure: Children in the treatment conditions played a less healthy or a healthier version of an advergame 2 times before choosing and eating a snack and completing the experimental measures. Children in the control group chose and ate a snack before playing the game and completing the measures.Main Outcome Measures: The number of healthier snack items children selected and ate and how much children liked the game.Results: Children who played the healthier version of the advergame selected and ate significantly more healthy snacks than did those who played the less healthy version. Children reported liking the advergame.Conclusions: Findings suggest that concerns about online advergames that market unhealthy foods are justified. However, advergames may also be used to promote healthier foods and beverages. This kind of social marketing approach could tip the scales toward the selection of higher-quality snacks, thereby helping to curb the obesity epidemic.},

abstract = {Bridging organisations are understood to play an important role in National and Sectoral Systems of Innovation (Freeman, 1987; Lundvall, 1993; Malerba, 2002) and Technological Systems (Carlsson and Stankiewitz, 1995) particularly in compensating for weaknesses in these systems, such as access to suppliers of technology, information, finance etc. However, to ensure their role is fulfilled we need to know more than we do currently about the organisational practices which make them effective. Furthermore, we need to develop theory on why and where they are needed. This paper will show how a public bridging organisation designs and manages an effective intervention through analysis of a complete sample of entrepreneurs participating in a series of \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}business clinics\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, co-ordinated by the bridging organisation on behalf of the electronic games industry in the UK. It will show that this globally regarded creative industry has some weaknesses and conservative tendencies, which threaten its capacity for radical or disruptive innovation. It will show how bridging organisations can compensate for these weaknesses.

The UK electronic games sector is renowned for the creativity of its content. However, the games Sectoral System of Innovation (SSI) has a number of weaknesses. Firstly, the UK no longer has domestically owned global publishers. Publishers play the important roles of financing games development, as well as co-ordinating their marketing and distribution. To most of the UK industry\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s independent developers they are distant and elusive (Spectrum-Strategy-Consultants, 2002; TerKeurst, 2003; Grantham and Kaplinsky, 2005).

Secondly, within a SSI certain types of innovation trajectory may be favoured at the expense of others. The dominant games trajectory is essentially greater processing power and photo-realistic graphics, with proven content in terms of franchises and movie tie-ins. The more radical propositions are unlikely to get a serious hearing from publishers. This creates a sector-wide \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\} Innovator\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Dilemma\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} (Christensen, 1997) where sustaining innovation trajectories of technical advance with rising costs are favoured at the expense of disruptive innovation- newer, cheaper technologies and ideas aimed at new markets.

The more creative and potentially disruptive ideas in the games industry are those that tend to overlap with other SSI. For example mobile phone games are emerging at the boundary of the games and mobile telecommunications SSI. In the SSI literature boundaries are thought to be dynamic, rather than fixed, and involve interdependencies between related sectors (Malerba, 2004:14; Edquist, 2004). Convergence may result in new sectors emerging from older established ones (Mowery and Nelson, 1999). But during the emergence there are institutional weaknesses in the areas of overlap.

Bridging organisations can mitigate the problems caused by these areas of weakness. Our study reports on a regional bridging organisation\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s intervention. The process involved entrepreneurs presenting their business propositions to a panel of industry experts for validation, refinement or rejection. We analyse the nature of the propositions and the impact of the intervention on them, identifying key design and process choices. We show how bridging capabilities can respond to and compensate for weaknesses in SSI in emerging industries, drawing on the entrepreneurship and disruptive innovation literatures.},

abstract = {The study extends research on the Proteus effect by demonstrating that avatars can prime negative attitudes and cognition in desktop virtual settings. Experiment 1 shows that, after virtual group discussions, participants using black-cloaked avatars developed more aggressive intentions and attitudes but less group cohesion than those using white-cloaked avatars. In Experiment 2, individual participants using a Ku Klux Klan (KKK)-associated avatar created more aggressive Thematic Apperception Test stories in comparison to a control group. Participants using the KKK avatar also wrote less affiliative stories in comparison to those employing avatars dressed as doctors. Overall, the resulting pattern of activation of negative thoughts (i.e., aggression) coupled with the inhibition of inconsistent thoughts (i.e., cohesion, affiliation) is consistent with principles of current priming models and provides initial evidence for automatic cognitive priming in virtual settings.},

abstract = {Educators and education advocates have recently acknowledged that the ability to think systemically is one of the necessary skills for success in the 21st century. Game-making is especially well-suited to encouraging meta-level reflection on the skills and processes that designer-players use in building such systems. Membership in a community of game producers means sharing thoughts and experiences with fellow players. This ability to gain fluency in specialist language and to translate thinking and talking about games into making and critiquing them (and vice versa) suggests that games not only teach literacy skills but support their ongoing use. Rather than imagining that education can be transformed by bringing games into the classroom, researchers should consider not only the effects of the thinking engendered by those who play, but also by those who design the play. This article offers an overview of the pedagogy and development process of Gamestar Mechanic, an RPG (Role Playing Game) style online game designed to teach players the fundamentals of game design. It will discuss some of the early results of the project, with an emphasis on the conceptual framework guiding the work, as well as the kinds of literacies and knowledge structures it is intended to support. },

abstract = {War games often try to simulate the characteristics of real weapons - their range, loading times and the bullets\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} caliber in order to create an authentic image of war. What they do not show is its authentic violence. Usually we do not see blood pixels and splatter orgies as in dungeon games in which the player has to fight monsters and zombies with eg. magic swords. Instead pictures of a clean war are presented in which civilians hardly ever appear and every weapon hits the target remote-controlled. Because of the simulation\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s naturalism gamers may believe that a genuine war looks like the one the screen - and, in fact, today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s soldiers are not faced with the \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}white in the eye of the enemy\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} any longer what they do see are symbols on the radar or abstract objects on a computer screen.Accordingly, the real war more and more looks like a computer game while the computer game increasingly looks like reality.Among the currently most popular war game genres are World War 2 games. They met their renaissance with the 1998 release of Stephen Spielberg\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Hollywood movie \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}Saving Private Ryan\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\}. The film starts with an impressive staging of the battle following the landing at Omaha Beach in 1944 and subsequently a number of WW2 games were published in which gamers could re-enact the battle over and over on the internet. The respective gamers are organised in so called clans which often refer to historical divisions of Allied forces or German troops. Some of them even play under the names of well-known SS divisions such as \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\}.Most of the other gamers in this community do not seem to object to SS-clans who argue that they were only re-enacting their idols\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} campaigns and did not share their biologist and racist world view. Thus, they try to promote the image of the bravely fighting SS-soldier in disregard of the war crimes committed by the Waffen-SS. Such arguments resemble the patterns used in speeches of the German Neo-Nazi party NPD.In my article, I will analyse popular war games and the way they try to advance the image of the brave soldier and a intriguing weapon technology while neglecting the effects of violence and atrocities and how these games do not appear in the daily discussion about violence and are mostly elided by the protection of minors.},

abstract = {Scalability is a critical issue for Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG). To address the scalability drawbacks of current central server model, we present a scenario to support MMORPG through Pastry, a structured peer-to-peer overlay. In order to closely reflect an advanced MMORPG configuration, the scenario considers bandwidth and latency constraints required by the games based on actual MMORPG traffic pattern. A simulation model is developed to evaluate the performance of Pastry in supporting such a scenario. Results show that Pastry performs well in distributing node stress. However, there is a bottleneck in terms of upstream bandwidth usage, which can be removed by low-cost algorithms. Results also show that using Scribe multicast tree built on top of Pastry to disseminate game traffic is an effective way to save bandwidth usage. In addition, Scribe multicast tree scales well in supporting the scenario with respect to the tree length. When a tree size increases five times, the length of the tree only increases less than two levels.},

Computer game is one of the software applied in most mobile embedded devices that be requested to handle more and more functions in recent year. Most researches of computer games focus on AI performance, computer vision, even social sciences. On the other hand, a large and increasing number of embedded systems are subject to tight power constraints, but strangely no one pays attention to the games on mobile embedded device at present. Our work recognizes the need to provide embedded software designers with feedback about the effect of different algorithms of computer games on energy consumption early in the design cycle. The ability to efficiently analyze battery life under different design choices of games is an important aid in designing battery-efficient systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of energy requirements in a wide range of the most used algorithms in different computer game types. Based on our results, we conclude and discuss various opportunities for realizing energy-efficient implementations of game algorithms. We believe that such investigations will be an important first step towards addressing the challenges of energy efficient algorithms for battery-constrained systems.},

Method: One hundred one children are recruited for the study (aged between 9 and 12 years). All participants played a motor-racing game on the computer for 1 hour. The TBAG form of the Stroop task was administered to all participants twice, before playing and immediately after playing the game. Results: Participants with improved posttest scores, compared to their pretest scores, used the computer on average 0.67 \{$\backslash$textpm\} 1.1 hr/day, while the average administered was measured at 1.6 \{$\backslash$textpm\} 1.4 hr/day and 1.3 \{$\backslash$textpm\} 0.9 hr/day computer use for participants with worse or unaltered scores, respectively. According to the regression model, male gender, younger ages, duration of daily computer use, and ADHD inattention type were found to be independent risk factors for worsened posttest scores. Conclusion: Time spent playing computer games can exert a short-term effect on attention as measured by the Stroop test. (J. of Att. Dis. 2010; 13(6) 668-676)},

abstract = {Video game enthusiasts spend many hours at play, and this intense activity has the potential to alter both brain and behavior. We review studies that investigate the ability of video games to modify processes in spatial cognition. We outline the initial stages of research into the underlying mechanisms of learning, and we also consider possible applications of this new knowledge. Several experiments have shown that playing action games induces changes in a number of sensory, perceptual, and attentional abilities that are important for many tasks in spatial cognition. These basic capacities include contrast sensitivity, spatial resolution, the attentional visual field, enumeration, multiple object tracking, and visuomotor coordination and speed. In addition to altering performance on basic tasks, playing action video games has a beneficial effect on more complex spatial tasks such as mental rotation, thus demonstrating that learning generalizes far beyond the training activities in the game. Far transfer of this sort is generally elusive in learning, and we discuss some early attempts to elucidate the brain functions that are responsible. Finally, we suggest that studying video games may contribute not only to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of learning but may also offer new approaches to teaching spatial skills.},

Of the myriad of newer computer applications currently available, computer gaming stands out for its unique potential to enhance end-user performance and job satisfaction. Research in other disciplines has demonstrated computer gaming to offer the potential for enhanced decision making, resource management, visual acuity, memory, and motor skills. Within medical imaging, video gaming provides a novel means to enhance radiologist and technologist performance and visual perception by increasing attentional capacity, visual field of view, and visual-motor coordination. These enhancements take on heightened importance with the increasing size and complexity of three-dimensional imaging datasets. Although these operational gains are important in themselves, psychologic gains intrinsic to video gaming offer the potential to reduce stress and improve job satisfaction by creating a fun and engaging means of spirited competition.

While most of existing e-commerce applications can be modified to run in a wireless environment, m-commerce also involves many more new applications that become possible only due to the wireless infrastructure. These applications include mobile financial services, user and location specific mobile advertising, mobile inventory management, wireless business re-engineering, and mobile interactive games. In addition to device and wireless constraints, mobile commerce would also be impacted by the dependability of wireless infrastructure. Unlike e-commerce applications that usually run on fixed networking infrastructure of fairly high dependability (approaching to about 100\%), m-commerce applications may not receive such high dependability from the existing and emerging wireless infrastructure. So far, most of the m-commerce research focuses on applications, devices, and security issues. We believe that some work is necessary in addressing the dependability challenges of the wireless infrastructure. In this paper, we present (a) the dependability issues of wireless infrastructure, (b) several architectures to improve the dependability of wireless networks, and (c) a simulation model and results on wireless dependability for m-commerce.

abstract = {Approaches to computer game playing based on alpha-beta search of the tree of possible move sequences combined with a position evaluation function have been successful for many games, notably Chess. Such approaches are less successful for games with large search spaces and complex positions, such as Go, and we are led to seek alternatives. One such alternative is to model the goals of the players, and their strategies for achieving these goals. This approach means searching the space of possible goal expansions, typically much smaller than the space of move sequences. Previous attempts to apply these techniques to Go have been unable to provide results for anything other than a high strategic level or very open game positions. In this paper we describe how adversarial hierarchical task network planning can provide a framework for goal-directed game playing in Go which is also applicable both strategic and tactical problems.},

abstract = {This article examines the notion of genre in video games. The main argument is that the market-based categories of genre that have been developed in the context of video games obscure the new medium's crucial defining feature, by dividing them into categories (loosely) organized by their similarities to prior forms of mediation. The article explores the inherent tension between the conception of video games as a unified new media form, and the current fragmented genre-based approach that explicitly or implicitly concatenates video games with prior media forms. This tension reflects the current debate, within the fledgling discipline of Game Studies, between those who advocate narrative as the primary tool for understanding video games, \&quot;narratologists,\&quot; and those that oppose this notion, \&quot;ludologists.\&quot; In reference to this tension, the article argues that video game genres be examined in order to assess what kind of assumptions stem from the uncritical acceptance of genre as a descriptive category. Through a critical examination of the key game genres, this article will demonstrate how the clearly defined genre boundaries collapse to reveal structural similarities between the genres that exist within the current genre system, defined within the context of visual aesthetic or narrative structure. The inability of the current genre descriptions to locate and highlight these particular features suggests that to privilege the categories of the visual and narrative is a failure to understand the medium. The article concludes by suggesting that the tension between \&quot;ludology\&quot; and \&quot;narratology\&quot; can be more constructively engaged by conceptualizing video games as operating in the interplay between these two taxonomies of genre.},

abstract = {Although there is considerable interest in the idea of using games for learning, success in this area has proven elusive. Clearly it is challenging to take established curricula developed for other media types and attempt to fit them into open-ended game contexts where content is secondary to experience. Digital games are very effective for learning, but they represent a type of productive play that does not fit neatly within established educational paradigms. Furthermore, play and learning take on new dimensions within the context of an increasingly participatory culture that blurs traditional boundaries between producers and consumers, as well as teachers and learners. In participatory contexts, learning is a systemic activity where the contributions of the individual contribute to the larger collective intelligence, and learning is often a by-product of play or creativity. Attempts to use games for learning must take this broader context into account and acknowledge the shifting expectations and emerging literacies of learners steeped in a digital culture that introduces and reinforces new standards for play and participation.},

abstract = {Distributed virtual environment (DVE) systems model and simulate the activities of thousands of entities interacting in a virtual world over a wide area network. Possible applications for DVE systems are multiplayer video games, military and industrial trainings, and collaborative engineering. In general, a DVE system is composed of many servers and each server is responsible to manage multiple clients who want to participate in the virtual world. Each server receives updates from different clients (such as the current position and orientation of each client) and then delivers this information to other clients in the virtual world. The server also needs to perform other tasks, such as object collision detection and synchronization control. A large scale DVE system needs to support many clients and this imposes a heavy requirement on networking resources and computational resources. Therefore, how to meet the growing requirement of bandwidth and computational resources is one of the major challenges in designing a scalable and cost-effective DVE system. In this paper, we propose an efficient partitioning algorithm that addresses the scalability issue of designing a large scale DVE system. The main idea is to dynamically divide the virtual world into different partitions and then efficiently assign these partitions to different servers. This way, each server will process approximately the same amount of workload. Another objective of the partitioning algorithm is to reduce the server-to-server communication overhead. The theoretical foundation of our dynamic partitioning algorithm is based on the linear optimization principle. We also illustrate how one can parallelize the proposed partitioning algorithm so that it can efficiently partition a very large scale DVE system. Lastly, experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning algorithm under various settings of the virtual world.},

abstract = {Emotions are an important aspect of human intelligence and have been shown to play a significant role in the human decision-making process. Researchers in areas such as cognitive science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence have proposed a variety of models of emotions. Most of the previous models focus on an agent\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s reactive behavior, for which they often generate emotions according to static rules or pre-determined domain knowledge. However, throughout the history of research on emotions, memory and experience have been emphasized to have a major influence on the emotional process. In this paper, we propose a new computational model of emotions that can be incorporated into intelligent agents and other complex, interactive programs. The model uses a fuzzy-logic representation to map events and observations to emotional states. The model also includes several inductive learning algorithms for learning patterns of events, associations among objects, and expectations. We demonstrate empirically through a computer simulation of a pet that the adaptive components of the model are crucial to users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} assessments of the believability of the agent\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s interactions.

The research subjects, with the help of a Pollimeter (Lampert, S.I., 1981, A new scale for consumer research: The Pollimeter combines properties for data collection and data analysis. Journal of Advertising Research, 21(2), 2329), answered to questionnaires, which examined their level of time on task acid their level of satisfaction with the various interfaces. The research findings indicate that there is a significant difference between boys and girls in the influence of the design of the learning interfaces on their level of time on task as well as on their level of satisfaction with the different interfaces. Boys on the one hand had a higher level of time on task, and were more familiar with computer games so they looked for assistance through navigational buttons; girls on the other hand tended to ask for help with the game. Girls preferred to include writing into the game and preferred colourful screens full of drawings, which changed slowly. We also found that boys preferred green and blue colours, whilst the girls preferred red and yellow. Generally speaking, we found that girls preferred the components of the Mise-en-scene interface, and boys preferred the components of the Montage interface.},

abstract = {Objective: The authors examined national trends from 1990 to 2000 in the utilization of community hospital inpatient services by young people (5-20 years of age) with intentional self-inflicted injuries. Method: Discharge abstracts from a nationally representative sample of community hospitals were analyzed, with a focus on youth discharges (N = 10,831) with a diagnosis of intentional self-inflicted injury (ICD-9-CM: E950-E959). Census data were used to derive national population-based rates of self-inflicted injuries requiring inpatient treatment. Overall population-based trends in hospitalizations for self-inflicted injury were calculated and stratified by gender and age. Among youths hospitalized with a self-inflicted injury, trends were also calculated for length of stay, inpatient costs, method of injury, and associated mental disorder diagnoses. Results: The annual hospitalization rate of youths with self-inflicted injuries declined from 49.1 per 100,000 in 1990 to 44.9 per 100,000 in 2000, and the mean length of inpatient stay significantly declined from 3.6 days to 2.7 days. Among the hospitalized patients, there were increases in the rate of cutting (4.3\% to 13.2\%) and ingestion of acetaminophen (22.1\% to 26.9\%), antidepressants (10.0\% to 14.0\%), and opiates (2.3\% to 3.3\%) as a cause of injury, whereas there were decreases in the ingestion of salicylates (14.9\% to 10.2\%) and barbiturates (1.5\% to 0.7\%). There were significant increases in the proportion of subjects with primary mental disorder discharge diagnoses of depressive disorder (29.2\% to 46.0\%), bipolar disorder (1.3\% to 8.2\%), and substance use disorder (5.4\% to 10.7\%) and significant decreases in the rate of adjustment disorders (22.2\% to 11.4\%) and non-mental disorders (31.9\% to 13.6\%). After excluding cutting, which may be more closely related to self-mutilation than suicidal self-injury, the annual hospitalization rate of youths with self-inflicted injuries declined from 47.2 per 100,000 in 1990 to 39.4 per 100,000 in 2000. Conclusions: Over the decade of study, young people admitted to community hospitals with self-inflicted injuries tended to have more severe psychiatric diagnoses and to be treated during shorter inpatient stays. These trends suggest that the role of youth inpatient care has narrowed, becoming focused on those with severe psychiatric disorders.},

Methods: A questionnaire about using media as a sleep aid, media presence in bedrooms, time to bed and time out of bed on average weekdays and average weekend days, and questions regarding level of tiredness in the morning, at school, after a day at school and after the weekend was completed by 2546 seventh and 10th grade children in a random sample of 15 schools. Results: Of the adolescents, 36.7\% reported watching television to help them fall asleep. In total, 28.2\% of the boys and 14.7\% of the girls used computer games as a sleep aid. Music was used to fall asleep by 60.2\% of the adolescents in this sample. About half of the adolescents read books to fall asleep. Except for reading books, using media as a sleep aid is negatively related to respondents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} time to bed on weekdays, their number of hours of sleep per week and their self-reported level of tiredness. Conclusion: Using media as a sleep aid appears to be common practice among adolescents. Those who reported using music, television, and computer games more often as a sleeping aid slept fewer hours and were significantly more tired.},

As such it provides a mechanism to deal with weaknesses in the game AI and to respond to changes in human player tactics. In prior work we designed a novel technique called "dynamic scripting" that is able to create successful adaptive opponents. However, experimental evaluations indicated that, occasionally, the time needed for dynamic scripting to generate effective opponents becomes unacceptably long. We investigated two different countermeasures against these long adaptation times (which we call "outliers"), namely a better balance between rewards and penalties, and a history-fallback mechanism. Experimental results indicate that a combination of these two countermeasures is able to reduce the number of outliers significantly. We therefore conclude that the performance of dynamic scripting is enhanced by these countermeasures.},

Advanced high resolution scanning technologies such as LIDAR enable us to obtain dense and accurate irregular terrain dataset. However, unlike the regular sampled dataset such as DEM and DTED, irregular dataset cannot be rendered in real-time due to random distribution of samples. Moreover, because they generally have huge amount of point data, it is very hard to manipulate them in consumer PC. We propose a fast and efficient terrain rendering method using large-scale irregular dataset for computer games application. First, it reconstructs the geometry by converting irregular dataset into regular one, through resampling input data with regular interval considering the spatial distribution of sample points. It can generate animated scene by applying quad-tree based rendering method to converted dataset. Experimental results show that its image quality is not deteriorated in comparison to the result of rendering reconstructed geometric models.},

Game difficulty level was manipulated in separate conditions by adjusting the number of enemies (view, easy, medium, and hard). Infrequently presented single-stimulus tones were either ignored or counted across difficulty conditions. Game performance and tone-counting accuracy declined as game difficulty increased. ERP component amplitudes diminished for both the tone ignore and counting conditions as game difficulty increased. The findings suggest that cognitive workload induced by video gaming can be reliably assessed through behavioral and neuroelectric means, and that the single-stimulus paradigm can be a useful tool for evaluating workload in an immersive stimulus environment with less distraction than conventional tools. $\backslash$copyright2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A stimulus, by virtue of its pairing with a rewarding or an aversive outcome, can acquire motivating properties reflecting that outcome. However, there is uncertainty concerning the extent to which such properties might be carried across contexts. In the current study we sought to determine whether conditioning-dependent motivational properties can transfer from a computer game to the real world and, further, whether this conditioning might be expressed in terms of brain responses measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied healthy participants conditioned with aversive and appetitive drinks in the context of a virtual cycling race. Three days after conditioning, participants returned for a fMRI session. We took this opportunity to observe the impact of incidental presentation of conditioned stimuli on a real-world decision (seat choice). We found a significant influence of conditioning on seat choice and, moreover, noted that individual susceptibility to this influence was reflected in differential insula cortex responses during subsequent scanning. The choice was also predicted by participants\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} personality scores and, as a statistical trend (p = 0.07), by their sense of immersion in the game environment. Our data show that motivational properties of stimuli can transfer from the virtual to the real world. While much concern has been expressed over the impact of virtual experience on general levels of aggression and mood, our data point to another important consideration: the fact that a stimulus in the virtual environment can acquire motivational properties that persist and modify behavior in the real world.},

A sample of 12 felonious juvenile residents (aged 15-18) from a highly restricted environment were assigned randomly to a biofeedback or video game group and trained for 10 half-hour sessions. Results indicated virtually no significant differences between biofeedback and video game training. However, pre and post differences for both groups combined demonstrated significant gains in impulsivity, EMG, and self-concept. Both groups rated themselves equally on self-control ability, regardless of training. Further comparisons between other institutionalized residents (N = 14) and staff counselors (N = 10) as non-treatment controls were made.

Through a case study Coyoacan, a tourist-oriented neighbourhood known for its historical richness and aesthetic qualities, I show how street vendors and artisans who were removed from plazas in the area engaged in a number of playful resistance strategies which drew on the symbolic and material importance of place. I argue the street vendors and artisans deployed playful techniques of resistance for two reasons. First, play helped develop emotions that were crucial for the sustainability of the movement. Second, playful strategies of resistance were practiced because of the symbolic importance of Coyoacan as a place of creativity, play, performance, and art.},

abstract = {We explore exploits possible for cheating in real-time, multiplayer games for both client-server and serverless architectures. We offer the first formalization of cheating in online games and propose an initial set of strong solutions. We propose a protocol that has provable anti-cheating guarantees, is provably safe and live, but suffers a performance penalty. We then develop an extended version of this protocol, called asynchronous synchronization, which avoids the penalty, is serverless, offers provable anti-cheating guarantees, is robust in the presence of packet loss, and provides for significantly increased communication performance. This technique is applicable to common game features as well as clustering and cell-based techniques for massively multiplayer games. Specifically, we provide a zero-knowledge proof protocol so that players are within a specific range of each other, and otherwise have no notion of their distance. Our performance claims are backed by analysis using a simulation based on real game traces.},

Results indicated that while television use was not related to children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s weight status, video game use was. Children with higher weight status played moderate amounts of electronic games, while children with lower weight status played either very little or a lot of electronic games. Interaction analyses revealed that this curvilinear relationship applied to children under age 8 and that girls, but not boys, with higher weight status played more video games. Children ages 9-12 with lower weight status used the computer (non-game) for moderate amounts of time, while those with higher weight status used the computer either very little or a lot. This was also true for the relationship between print use and weight status for children of all ages. Results also indicated that children with higher weight status spent more time in sedentary activities than those with lower weight status.},

The participants played either a nonviolent (NBA Jam(TM)) or one of three levels of a violent (Mortal Kombat(TM)) video game. After playing the video game for 15 minutes participants rewarded and punished a male or female confederate in a teacher/learner paradigm. Participants rewarded male (but not female) confederates with significantly more jellybeans under the basketball condition than under any of the martial arts conditions. Participants rewarded confederates more under the NEA Jam condition than any of the Mortal Kombat conditions, bur the Mortal Kombat conditions did not differ significantly from one another. Participants punished confederates significantly more after playing Mortal Kombat II than after playing NEA Jam. While participants were punished more harshly under the Mortal Kombat II condition than the Mortal Kombat conditions, these differences were not significant. Post hoc analyses showed that females were punished significantly more stringently as game violence increased but this finding should be interpreted with caution.},

The effectiveness of our strategy was tested in a study with thirty six subjects, where the system was shown to reliably synchronise and gather data for affect analysis. A pattern- recognition strategy known as Hidden Markov Models was applied to each subject\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physiological signals of skin conductivity and blood volume pressure in an effort to see if regimes of likely frustration could be automatically discriminated from regimes when frustration was much less likely. This pattern- recognition approach performed significantly better than random guessing at classifying the two regimes. Mouse-clicking behaviour was also synchronised to frustration-eliciting events and analysed, revealing four distinct patterns of clicking responses. We provide recommendations and guidelines for using physiology as a dependent measure for HCI experiments, especially when considering human emotions in the HCI equation.},

These applications often rely on a scenario that is revealed to the user as he/she interacts with synthetic objects and characters that inhabit virtual worlds. Current interactive narrative architectures used in the interactive entertainment industry often use decision trees, which are hard to author and modify. Some interactive entertainment productions are starting to use more generative techniques, such as plan-based or goal-based narrative. In this paper, I present an interactive narrative architecture that extends current research in interactive narrative by integrating a user modeling and user behavior analysis technique, which I argue facilities a more engaging and fulfilling experience. I have implemented the architecture within an interactive story called Mirage. The architecture resulted from an iterative design and development process involving a team that included film and theatre professionals. During this design and development process, I have experimented and evaluated different narrative techniques, which resulted in the proposed architecture.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare energy expenditure rates in children playing the physically active video games, Dance Dance Revolution ( DDR) and Nintendo\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Wii Sports in relation to treadmill walking.METHODS: Energy expenditure, heart rate, step rate, and perceived exertion were measured in 14 boys and 9 girls ( ages 10-13 years; BMI at 3-98th percentile for age and gender) while watching television at rest, playing DDR at 2 skill levels, playing Wii bowling and boxing, and walking at 2.6, 4.2, and 5.7 km/h. Arterial elasticity was measured at rest and immediately after gaming.RESULTS: Compared with watching television, energy expenditure while gaming or walking increased 2- to 3-fold. Similarly, high rates of energy expenditure, heart rate, and perceived exertion were elicited from playing Wii boxing, DDR level 2, or walking at 5.7 km/h. This occurred despite variations in step rate among activities, reflecting greater use of upper body during Wii play ( lowest step rate) than during walking ( highest step rate) or DDR play. Wii bowling and beginner level DDR elicited a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure compared to television watching. Large-artery elasticity declined immediately after both DDR and Wii. The change was inversely related to the increment in energy expenditure above rest achieved during the activity.CONCLUSIONS: Energy expenditure during active video game play is comparable to moderate-intensity walking. Thus, for children who spend considerable time playing electronic screen games for entertainment, physically active games seem to be a safe, fun, and valuable means of promoting energy expenditure.

abstract = {Large scale distributed virtual environments (DVEs) have become a major trend in distributed applications, mainly due to the enormous popularity of multi-player online games in the entertainment industry. Since architectures based on networked servers seem to be not scalable enough to support massively multi-player applications, peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures have been proposed as an efficient and truly scalable solution for this kind of systems. However, in order to design efficient DVEs based on peer-to-peer architectures these systems must be characterized, measuring the impact of different client behaviors on system performance. This paper presents the experimental characterization of peer-to-peer distributed virtual environments in regard to well-known performance metrics in distributed systems. Characterization results show that system saturation is inherently avoided due to the peerto-peer scheme, as it could be expected. Also, these results show that the saturation of a given client exclusively has an effect on the surrounding clients in the virtual world, having no noticeable effect at all on the rest of avatars. Finally, the characterization results show that the response time offered to client computers greatly depends on the number of new connections that these clients have to make when new neighbors appear in the virtual world. These results can be used as the basis for an efficient design of peer-to-peer DVE systems.

abstract = {In 1976, Exidy's Death Race triggered the United States’ first video gaming moral panic. Public outrage not only fueled sales of the game and made Exidy a household name, but established a pattern by which controversial games receive a high levels of press attention, which in turn drives these games' marketplace success. Exidy released Death Race in the midst of changing cinema production codes and distribution regulations that led to the emergence of films featuring unprecedented displays of violence and sexuality. The game is based on one of these films, Death Race 2000, in which competitors in the Annual Transcontinental Road Race mow down pedestrians for points. Although the filmmakers did not authorize the use of their concepts for the game, the game relies directly on the film's narrative. The chase-and-crash game invites players to strike stick-figure "gremlins" with on-screen cars. Context, including the game's cabinet graphics and the film, contributed to moral guardians' perception that the game was celebrating violence. However, Death Race was distributed in a market filled with numerous other violent games. This suggests the game triggered outrage not only because it was violent, but because it depicted violence which questioned the state's monopoly on legitimized violence and did not follow culturally accepted narratives of violence, such as military or police violence, or the western. Public disapproval of Death Race did not squelch distribution, instead driving sales and vaulting Exidy into the national spotlight. Discourse surrounding Death Race forged a strong tie between video gaming and violence in the public imagination, ensuring the development of similarly violent games. This bond has persisted and led to the development of several similar games, including the controversial Grand Theft Auto franchise, which is the progeny of Death Race in both narrative theme and reception.},

abstract = {Games technology has undergone tremendous development. In this article, the authors report the rapid advancement that has been observed in the way games software is being developed, as well as in the development of games content using game engines. One area that has gained special attention is modeling the game environment such as terrain and buildings. This article presents the continuous level of detail terrain modeling techniques that can help generate and render realistic terrain in real time. Deployment of characters in the environment is increasingly common. This requires strategies to map scalable behavior characteristics for characters as well. The authors present two important aspects of crowd simulation: the realism of the crowd behavior and the computational overhead involved. A good simulation of crowd behavior requires delicate balance between these aspects. The focus in this article is on human behavior representation for crowd simulation. To enhance the player experience, the authors present the concept of player adaptive entertainment computing, which provides a personalized experience for each individual when interacting with the game. The current state of game development involves using very small percentage (typically 4\% to 12\%) of CPU time for game artificial intelligence (AI). Future game AI requires developing computational strategies that have little involvement of CPU for online play, while using CPU\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s idle capacity when the game is not being played, thereby emphasizing the construction of complex game AI models offline. A framework of such nonconventional game AI models is introduced.},

The responses of blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI contrasts while playing games or viewing pseudo-visual stimuli similar to the video games were measured with a 1.5 Tesla scanner in 10 right-handed healthy participants performing experiments and analysed using statistical parametric mapping. Increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, the premotor cortex, the parietal cortex and the visual association cortex was specifically associated with playing the three video games. Othello and Tetris, which require logical thinking, activated broader areas of the prefrontal cortex, and Space Invader and Tetris, which require real-time reaction, activated broader areas of the premotor and parietal cortex. These results indicate that the areas of brain activation while playing different-genre video games depended on the combination of required skills for each game. $\backslash$copyright2007 IEEE.},

However, it is less well-understood how these changes take place. One explanation is that the mechanism for change is generational: doctoral students transform research disciplines as they apply new electronic communication skills they "grew up with." This article examines this explanation and related claims through evidence from a study of 28 graduate students and their advisors in four disciplines at eight U.S. research universities. Although all the doctoral students used electronic communication technologies in various ways, their work practices reinforced existing patterns of work and resource use in their disciplines. Students used electronic communication to (1) mimic the electronic communication patterns of their advisor, (2) differentiate or specialize their research with respect to their advisor or research specialty, (3) enhance the social connections and material resources their advisor or institution provided to them, and/or (4) ease or improve "hands-on" research techniques (textual analysis, wet lab work, programming, statistical analysis) that their advisor or research group delegated to them.},

One key discursive construction in contemporary game culture is to portray some games as ‘real’ or ‘authentic,’ rendering others as fake or lesser. In this essay we analyze the discourse of real games by focusing on four key discursive constructions that prop up notions of real games: developer pedigree, game mechanics, the celebration of depth and complexity, and the payment structure for games. Using the framework of constitutive rhetoric we argue that these appeals also construct a category of real gamers that has a substantial impact on what games are available and how we think about them.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between physical activity and inactivity patterns and overweight in U.S. adolescents using baseline and 1-year change in activity and inactivity data. Research Methods and Procedures: Nationally representative data from 12,759 participants (6997 non-Hispanic whites, 2676 non-Hispanic blacks, 2185 Hispanics. and 901 Asians) in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995 and 1996). Data on moderate to vigorous and low-intensity physical activity, TV/video viewing, and video game/computer use were obtained from questionnaires. Multivariate models assessed the association of overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to 95th percentile Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics 2000 curves) with initial (and 1-year change) activity and inactivity levels, controlling for age. ethnicity, socioeconomic status, urban residence, cigarette smoking, and region of residence. Results: Overweight prevalence was positively associated with high level TV/video viewing among white boys (odds ratio = 1.52; 95\% confidence interval ) and girls (OR = 2.45 ). The odds of overweight decreased with high levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity among white boys (OR = 0.81 ), non-Hispanic black boys (OR = 0.86 ) and girls (OR = 0.88 ). and Hispanic boys (OR = 0.90 ) and girls (OR = 0.91 ). Discussion: Predicted probabilities generated from the logistic regression models. which examined the experimental effects of altering hours of TV/video viewing and bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity, show lower overweight among adolescents who watched less TV per week combined with frequent moderate to vigorous physical activity than those who watched more TV per week combined with fewer bouts of weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity. Predicted probabilities suggest important sex and ethnic differences in these associations.},

abstract = {In the emerging academic field of game studies, Roger Caillois\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} Les Jeux et les hommes has already received the status of an obligatory reference. It is honoured as one of the few classic texts in game theory, but some also argue that it is not useful for analysing digital games. Gaillois\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} book is of particular interest for cultural theorists, though, because it presents a theory of games and play while also addressing the meaning of play. After analysing more closely why Caillois\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} theory falls short when it is applied to digital games, we suggest a slight modification of its categories. Starting from the four game dimensions outlined by Caillois competition, chance, simulation and vertigo - and his two modes of playing, paidia and ludus, we build on his theory by distinguishing two additional game characteristics, called repens and repositio. Both deal with the internal, temporal organization of a game. Repens is a specific characteristic of games that appeals to the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s desire to discover, explore and get to know the surprises a game has in store and to make progress by learning from these surprises. Repositio denotes complementary experiences: having to retry, return, replay and repeat a certain action while getting better at it with every try. The balance, or unbalance, between repens and repositio, as characteristic elements of many digital games, determines to a large extent their attraction. Finally, repens and repositio are not only indicators of fun in the playing of digital games; they also hint at basic elements in learning theories and social theory. The study of the interplay between repens and repositio can help in clarifying the possibilities and limitations of digital games for learning purposes.},

abstract = {Explaining the emergence of cooperative behaviours in a selfish world remains a major challenge for sociobiology. The iterated prisoner\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s dilemma offers a well-studied metaphor with which to explore theoretically the evolution of cooperation by reciprocation. Our current understanding is that \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}tit-for-tat\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} should be the very first step (if not the aim) of evolution towards cooperation, but that mobility of the players in space seems to raise a devastating obstacle to the spread of tit-for-tat, by allowing egoists to exploit cooperation and escape retaliation. The second point is based on models that represent mobility only implicitly (in terms of travelling costs) and assume random interactions. Here we develop a more explicit theory of spatial iterated games: individual mobility is represented in terms of a diffusion process and interactions - defined locally - are inherently non-random. Our model reveals the existence of critical levels of individual mobility allowing for the evolution of cooperation. In fact, tit-for-tat can spread and take over among mobile players even when originating from extreme rarity. The dynamics of invasion of tit-for-tat develop as a travelling wave which propagates the cooperative strategy through space. Significant mobility is required to make the pioneering moves of cooperators towards the front of invasion less hazardous; it also contributes to neutralizing those defectors who may intrude the core of a cluster of cooperative players.},

abstract = {This paper outlines a framework for understanding gameplay from the perspective of ecological psychology. According to this perspective, gameplay can be described in terms of perceiving, acting on and transforming the affordances that are related to a game system or to other players in a game. Challenges in games have an emphasis on perceiving suitable actions and/or performing suitable actions, often with emphasis on one aspect. For example, in many board games, strategy games and puzzle games, the challenge is to perceive appropriate affordances while in many sports, multiplayer shooter games, racing games, etc. the challenge is to use appropriate affordances. From this follows that the ecological approach to gameplay overrides the division of games as being digital and non-digital games.},

In addition, the comparison with the original German work of Dutch phenomenologist Gerardus van der Leeuw suggests that Risen’s ludological-narrative complex of hit points ("life energy") enacts a 20th century essentialistic and phenomenological conception of religion that has made its way into, and was specifically framed by, the new medium of digital games.},

This creates barriers to independent game developers and inhibits the introduction of innovative games, or new game genres. In this paper the PlayMancer platform is introduced, a work in progress aiming to overcome such barriers by augmenting existing 3D game engines with innovative modes, of interaction. Playmancer integrates open source existing systems, such as a game engine and a spoken dialog management system, extended by newly implemented components, supporting innovative interaction modalities. such as emotion recognition from audio data, motion tracking, etc, and advanced configuration tools.},

Studies have focused on the weaknesses of business gaming simulation; which is often regarded as an educational medium that has limitations regarding learning effectiveness. However, no attempts have been made to provide guidelines for assessing educational validity in terms of building, implementing, and validating business gaming simulation. Accordingly, this study has combined literature on learning, simulation design, and research methods to formulate a methodology to assess the educational validity of total enterprise simulation; the concepts of which can be applied more broadly to business gaming simulation.

Buying a patient simulator, finding a volunteer to act as the patient, or even obtaining ready-made scenarios from another simulation center are rarely insurmountable challenges. The issue often lies in how to use or adapt these for your own purpose: with your team, facilities, and resources but primarily for your learners. Published information is limited in the area of scenario preparation for health care education and continuing medical education or continuing professional development. This article is a guide for clinical tutors, standardized patient trainers, and patient simulator operators on how to script scenarios and proposes a new detailed and reusable template for writing scenarios.

abstract = {he USDHHS recommends that children accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each day. Regular physical activity is believed to be an important component for reducing the levels of obesity. One way to increase physical activity levels that is gaining popularity is interactive video games (exergames). This is evidenced by its use in school districts throughout the US and also in middle schools throughout the state of West Virginia. Two of the more popular exergames are Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) by Konami, Inc. and EyeToy Play by Sony, Inc. DDR is a dance simulation game which requires the player to step (lower-body) on a motion sensing dance pad; whereas, EyeToy is a game that requires the use of the arms (upper-body) to play the games. At this time, there is little evidence to suggest one game is more effective than the other for accumulating MVPA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in time spent in MVPA while playing DDR and EyeToy. Design: Participants in this study were 12 children (ages 9-18) from a local YMCA that were invited to play both DDR and EyeToy while wearing a heart rate monitor. Seven of the children were girls; five were boys. Each child was permitted to play each game on different days for up to 45 minutes. Results: An analysis of gender difference of each game revealed no significant difference (p = .455); therefore, the data was collapsed. Overall, participants spent more time in MVPA while playing DDR when compared to EyeToy, 80.84\% to 53.45\% respectively. This difference was found to be significant (p =.039) using a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. For this study, it appears that playing DDR was more effective than EyeToy for accumulating MVPA. It is important to note that both exergames were played at MVPA for at least half of the time (>= 20 mins), and all participants played the entire 45 minutes except one. These findings suggest that these two exergames could be healthy alternatives to other physical activities for accumulating the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA.},

Over time, the landscape of these worlds evolves and changes as players create and personalise their own virtual property. In contrast, many non-player characters that populate virtual game worlds possess a fixed set of pre-programmed behaviours and lack the ability to adapt and evolve in time with their surroundings. This paper presents motivated reinforcement learning agents as a means of creating non-player characters that can both evolve and adapt. Motivated reinforcement learning agents explore their environment and learn new behaviours in response to interesting experiences, allowing them to display progressively evolving behavioural patterns. In dynamic worlds, environmental changes provide an additional source of interesting experiences triggering further learning and allowing the agents to adapt their existing behavioural patterns in time with their surroundings.

However, the products offered by the major manufacturers have a major barrier to their acquisition: very high prices. There is an urgent need to use new technologies in order to provide solutions that present the same performance levels than typical interactive whiteboards, but with a significantly reduced cost. Throughout this paper the steps taken for the development of an innovative low-cost interactive whiteboard are described. The proposed system is based on the Wii Remote command of the Nintendo Wii video-game console. This command, although very inexpensive has an infrared camera, and supports Bluetooth communication. The system control is based on a wireless device, based on infrared emitters, which supports most of the mouse events. A complete whiteboard application was also developed using Borland Delphi for Windows. This application may be used with either one or two Wiimotes and has a very simple and efficient calibration method. The application also includes viewing capabilities of some of the Wiimote characteristics, as well as a flexible Notebook to increase its range of possible uses. The results obtained through a survey conducted to a small set of whiteboard users were very positive indicators about the acceptance of the inexpensive solution proposed.},

Volunteers in an elderly community in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to a videogame-playing experimental group or a non-playing control group. The televisions of the 10 videogame players were provided with Nintendo SuperNes systems. Participants played Super Tetris 5 hours a week for 5 weeks, and maintained a log of their play. Before and after this play period, measures of reaction time (Sternberg Test), cognitive/perceptual adaptability (Stroop Color Word Test), and emotional well-being (self-report questionnaire) were administered. Playing video games was related to a significant improvement in the Sternberg reaction time task, and to a relative increase in self-reported well-being. On the Stroop Color Word Test, both the experimental and control groups improved significantly, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant. The videogame-playing group had faster reaction times and felt a more positive sense of well-being compared to their nonplaying counterparts. Consistent with previous research on video games and the elderly, the present study finds the strongest effects on measures of reaction time, and the weakest effects on cognitive performance measures. Explanations and alternative interpretations of these findings are discussed.},

To test the usability of ScriptEase, the tool has been used as an aid to help with the short story unit of a Grade 10 Alberta high school English curriculum. This paper describes ScriptEase and reports on our experience in using it in the classroom.},

Working under the assumption that teenagers prefer to make their own decisions rather than be given information, the game was developed as an attempt to illustrate to teens the negative consequences associated with drug use. The game is comprised of simulations requiring teens to make decisions regarding drug use and respond to the consequences of such decisions. The impact of the program user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s choices is clearly presented. The program can provide teens with a forum for experimentation in which they experience likely outcomes of their decisions.

abstract = {User toolkits for innovation were recently proposed as a means to eliminate (costly) exchange of need-related information between users and manufactures in the product development process. The method transfers certain development tasks to users and thereby empowers them to create their own desired product features. This article examines the implications of different levels of opportunities for consumer involvement (OCI) in product development to learn what happens when firms pass design tasks on to consumers. It explores this issue by studying the relation between the employment of user toolkits and the need for firms to support their consumers. An analysis of 78 computer games products and the amount of support given by firms to the consumers of these products suggests that a share of the costs firms save on information acquisition by letting consumers "do it themselves" may eventually reemerge as costs in consumer support. In other words, an increase in opportunities for consumer involvement seems to increase the need for supporting consumers. A promising solution to the problem of support costs is identified, namely, the establishment of consumer-consumer support interaction. A case study of an outlier in terms of firm support to consumers-Westwood Studios-shows that consumers who use toolkits may be willing to support each other. Such interactive problem solving in a firm-established user community is advantageous to the firm, because the process reduces the amount of resources that the firm itself needs to dedicate to the support of consumers using toolkits. Generally, consumer-to-consumer interaction can facilitate problem-solving in the consumer domain, can aid the diffusion of toolkit related knowledge, and potentially can enhance the outcomes produced by the toolkit approach.},

The framework was created in order to illustrate and acknowledge the direct role of in-game audio in shaping player-to-player interactions and creating a sense of immersion in the game world. The emphasis placed upon graphical representation to-date within scholarly work and by the industry itself has left the significance of game audio theoretically underdeveloped and undervalued. Our work therefore seeks to deliver a conceptual language for the understanding, discussion and design of electronic and digital game sound. The first phase of this long-term research program entailed examining the degree to which it is possible to apply existing concepts from related disciplines such as Film Theory, Psychology and Soundscape Theories in addition to constructing new concepts to account for the unique way games function as new media. The resulting conceptual framework reflects our contention that FPS game environments are best understood as an acoustic ecology.

Modern software of all kinds, such as game software, is evolving to be massively distributed, with servers interacting with thousands of users at once. The move to Web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) built with technologies like Ajax and Ruby follows hard on the heels of online games. Bugs and flaws in software, which involve time and state problems tangled in complex trust models, account for a majority of computer security risks. Telehacking uses the direct player character location, and plenty of software-related state boundaries are frequent with timing problems. Switching from one virtual environment to another is a normal event in a game, and game company quality assurance (QA) has certainly tested it with a defined test plan.

Although normal A type tympanograms were initially observed, B type tympanograms and a decrease in hearing acuity to a hearing level of 35 dB on both sides was seen when he sniffed with both nostrils pinched (the reverse Valsalva maneuver). The patient would repeat the action on such occasions as when he wanted to concentrate on playing computer games while his mother was watching TV with the volume up, while he was swimming, or when the surroundings were noisy between lessons at school. When he wanted to normalize hearing, he would adjust the position of the tympanic membranes by performing the Valsalva maneuver. The patient probably had incomplete closure of the eustachian tube. The eustachian tube could be locked by high negative middle ear pressure induced by the reverse Valsalva maneuver, which resulted in a decrease of hearing acuity caused by retraction of the tympanic membranes bilaterally.},

Based on an ethnographic investigation of two online, text-based gaming environments, this study analyzes dynamics such as technical acculturation, access to technical knowledge, and opportunities for self-expression by studying social interaction that occurred in non-revenue-generating games. Frameworks that focus on dynamics such as in-game conversation in broader game-centric domains or ecologies should be considered to accommodate a wider variety of gaming forms and related interdisciplinary research questions. Different games have different consequences, and it is important to understand the varying consequential contexts that games afford. Whether or not the consequences may be measured economically, it is nevertheless important to consider how social interactions may complicate forms of self-expression in ways that impact the human spirit.},

abstract = {It is widely agreed that the traditional process of schooling can benefit from the usage of computers as supportive tools. Of various approaches using computers in education over the last decade, e-learning and edutainment have become the most prominent. Recently, a number of authors have criticised these approaches arguing that they conserve traditional \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}drill and practice\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} behaviouristic methods of teaching instead of enhancing and augmenting them. It has been proposed that a \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}paradigm shift\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} is needed and that this shift may come through utilizing all the advantages of full-fledged video games, so-called digital game-based learning (DGBL). However, several case studies reported serious problems with the DGBL. Among the most notable issues are the lack of acceptance of games as an educational tool, problems with integration of games into formal schooling environments, and the so-called transfer problem, which is the problem of the inherent tension between game play and learning objectives, the tension that mitigates the ability of students to transfer knowledge gained in the video game to the real-world context. Here, we present a framework for an augmented learning environment (ALE), which verbalises one way of how these problems can be challenged. The ALE framework has been constructed based on our experience with the educational game, Europe 2045, which we developed and which has been implemented in a number of secondary schools in the Czech Republic during 2008. The key feature of this game is that it combines principles of on-line multi-player computer games with social, role-playing games. The evaluation which we present in this paper indicates the successful integration of the game and its acceptance by teachers and students. The ALE framework isolates key principles of the game contributing to this success, abstracts them into theoretical entities we call action-based spaces and causal and grounding links, and condenses them in a coherent methodological structure, which paves the way for further exploitation of the DGBL by educational game researchers and designers.},

This study contrasted the influence of media context (play, watch) and psychological response (telepresence) on consumer recall, game liking, and perceived persuasion for real and fictitious brands in a racing game. Results show that playing the game impeded recall, but had no effect on game liking or perceived persuasion across brands. Telepresence and game liking were positively related to perceived persuasion for real and fictitious brands, with telepresence mediating the effect of game liking on perceived persuasion for real brands. Results are explained according to cognitive capacity and media context effects.},

The pattern of performance on those mental rotation tasks revealed that skilled Tetris Players used the same mental rotation procedures as non-Tetris players, but when Tetris shapes were used, they executed them more quickly. In Experiment 2, non-Tetris players who received 12 hours of Tetris-playing experience did not differ from matched control students in pretest-to-posttest gains on tests of spatial ability. However, Tetris-experienced participants were more likely to use an alternative type of mental rotation for Tetris shapes than were Tetris-inexperienced participants. The results suggest that spatial expertise is highly domain-specific and does not transfer broadly to other domains.},

In this position paper, we draw on literature from anthropology, sociology, and film to challenge long-standing misconceptions of "games" and "work" and of "virtuality" and "reality" as dualisms that have obscured synthetic worlds from serious consideration by IS scholars. Building on this work and recent reports of businesses, nonprofits, entrepreneurs, and educational institutions incorporating synthetic worlds into their day-to-day practices, we argue that synthetic worlds represent a legitimate arena for IS research. We begin by offering a framework for characterizing the nature and structure of the social activity occurring in the diverse array of synthetic worlds currently available. Then we illustrate our position by considering synthetic worlds from the perspective of organizational communication, a substantive area with a rich tradition in IS research. Employing a genre lens as an illustrative example, we identify phenomena and raise research questions the IS community is uniquely positioned to explore.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Seizures provoked by television viewing may be triggered by patterns in the television image or by flicker from the display itself. We examined the incidence of EEG abnormalities elicited by patterns displayed on television sets with two different frame rates to evaluate the likely contribution of photosensitive and pattern-sensitive mechanisms to television- and video-game epilepsy. METHODS: Televisions with frame rates of 50 and 100 Hz were used to present 35 patients who were photosensitive or pattern-sensitive with grating patterns. These patterns comprised vertical square-wave and sine-wave gratings of 90\% contrast, and the spatial frequency was varied between 0.25-7 cycles/degree. EEGs were analysed for laboratory sensitivity to patterned and unpatterned intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). RESULTS: Significantly fewer EEG abnormalities were elicited by patterns displayed on the 100 Hz frame-rate television than on the 50-Hz frame-rate television. No abnormalities were observed in response to the blank screens of either television. Thirty-three patients showed abnormalities in response to patterned IPS but only 15 in response to diffuse flash. Two patients showed no laboratory evidence of photosensitivity. Patients who were sensitive to patterned IPS at 50 Hz were significantly more likely to demonstrate abnormalities to patterns displayed on the 100-Hz frame-rate television than were patients who were not sensitive to 50-Hz patterned IPS. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that for many patients, the combination of high-contrast patterns and screen flicker may elicit the observed EEG abnormalities. For patients with sensitivity to screen flicker, the use of a high frame-rate television may be beneficial in reducing the risk of seizures.},

abstract = {Hitchers is a game for mobile phones that exploits cellular positioning to support location-based play. Players create digital hitch hikers, giving them names, destinations and questions to ask other players, and then drop them into their current phone cell. Players then search their current cell for hitchers, pick them up, answer their questions, carry them to new locations and drop them again, providing location-labels as hint to where they can be found. In this way, hitchers pass from player to player, phone to phone and cell to cell, gathering information and encouraging players to label cells with meaningful place names. A formative study of Hitchers played by 47 players over 4 months shows how the seams in cellular positioning, including varying cell size, density and overlap, affected the experience. Building on previous discussions of designing for uncertainty and seamful design, we consider five ways of dealing with these seams: removing, hiding, managing, revealing and exploiting them. This leads us to propose the mechanism of a dynamic search focus, to explore new visualization tools for cellular data, and to reconsider the general relationship between \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}virtual\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}physical\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} worlds in location-based games.},

abstract = {Activity of the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) displays a mixture of sensory, motor, and memory signals. Moreover, they often encode signals reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence that certain eye movements might lead to a desirable outcome. However, when the environment changes dynamically, animals are also required to combine the information about its previously chosen actions and their outcomes appropriately to update continually the desirabilities of alternative actions. Here, we investigated whether LIP neurons encoded signals necessary to update an animal\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s decision-making strategies adaptively during a computer-simulated matching-pennies game. Using a reinforcement learning algorithm, we estimated the value functions that best predicted the animal\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s choices on a trial-by-trial basis. We found that, immediately before the animal revealed its choice, similar to 18\% of LIP neurons changed their activity according to the difference in the value functions for the two targets. In addition, a somewhat higher fraction of LIP neurons displayed signals related to the sum of the value functions, which might correspond to the state value function or an average rate of reward used as a reference point. Similar to the neurons in the prefrontal cortex, many LIP neurons also encoded the signals related to the animal\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s previous choices. Thus, the posterior parietal cortex might be a part of the network that provides the substrate for forming appropriate associations between actions and outcomes.},

In general, students learned and practised a variety of language and technology skills with the design projects.

Various suggestions, based on the teacher and student experiences of these projects, are made for other language teachers interested in conducting creative game-based projects with their students.},

abstract = {In this paper, our research team demonstrates how groups of game designers can open the discussion on human principles in game design by using a tool we call “Values Cards.” Drawing on prior play experiences, participants identify examples of games or game segments that express the value represented on one of the values cards. This sparks deep analysis of how values are expressed through particular game mechanics and representational elements. The analysis can be posted to a collective wiki and shared amongst other designers who are interested in examining game mechanics and representational elements from a values perspective. These exercises can be considered first steps in a broader attempt to produce and implement a systematic methodology to better integrate human principles into the design process.},

abstract = {Of the rapidly growing amount of digital educational material, very little bridges the gap between experimental learning environments and computer-based learning environments. In this paper, a concept that bridges this gap is presented. The concept is based on observations in the subject of home economics in Danish primary and lower secondary school. The work is based on the theory of flow, storyline and computer games. The concept is exemplified by a prototype of a MOO storyline. The prototype proposes a way to integrate the technology in a way that makes use of children\&\#39;s natural curiosity and motivation for game playing combined with the joy of working with food and thus is a step on the road to producing a learning resource in an area that until now has been dominated by electronic recipe managers and digital health-tracking managers.

to develop an innovative, hands-on curriculum for engaging traditionally underserved
youth in the development and dissemination of online \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}casual\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} games that address social
and global issues. The Playing 4 Keeps games are designed by the program\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s youth
participants to educate their peers around the world about important social justice issues.
In the first year of the program\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s implementation, academic year 2005-06, the youth
collaborated with the game design company Gamelab and chose education in Haiti as
their topic of focus, which culminated in the development of Ayiti: The Cost of Life. In
the second year of implementation, the youth collaborated with a youth-run interactive
collective, Digital Refinery, to build a game in the virtual world, Teen Second Life. The
game CONSENT! focuses on racism and health issues by looking at medical
experimentation on prisoners. In an effort to understand various aspects of the after
school program, Global Kids asked the Education Development Center, Inc.\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Center for
Children and Technology (EDC/CCT) to serve as its program evaluator.
This report focuses on activities that occurred during Year 2 of the Playing 4 Keeps
program. The report reviews methods, program activities, which include Ayiti game user
experiences, the use of Ayiti in educational settings, and Playing 4 Keeps participants\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}
experiences, and concludes with recommendations for the continued implementation of
Playing 4 Keeps activities.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel application for speech technology to aid students with vocabulary acquisition in a foreign language through interactive card games. We describe a generic platform for card game development and then introduce a particular prototype card game called Word War, designed for learning Mandarin Chinese. We assess the feasibility of deploying Word War via the Internet by conducting our first user study remotely and evaluating the performance of the speech recognition component. It was found that the three central concepts in our system were recognized with ail error rate of 16.02\%. We then turn to assessing the effects of the Word War game on vocabulary retention in a controlled environment. To this end, we performed a user study using two variants of the Word War game: a speaking mode, in which the user issues spoken commands to manipulate the game cards, and a listening mode, in which the computer gives spoken directions that the students must follow by manipulating the cards manually with the mouse. These two modes of learning were compared against a more traditional computer assisted vocabulary learning system: an oil-line flash cards program. To assess long-term learning gains as a function of time-on-task, we had the students interact with each system twice over a period of three weeks. We found that all three systems were competitive in terms of the vocabulary words learned as measured by pre-tests and post-tests, with less than a 5\% difference among the systems\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} average overall learning gains. We also conducted surveys, which indicated that the students enjoyed the speaking mode of Word War more than the other two systems.},

abstract = {There is some concern that playing computer games may be associated with social isolation, lowered self-esteem and aggression among adolescents. Measures of these variables were included in a questionnaire completed by 204 year eight students at a North London comprehensive school. Principal components analysis of a scale to assess needs fulfilled by game play provided some support for the notion of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}electronic friendship\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} among boys, but there was no evidence that game play leads to social isolation. Play was not linked to self- esteem in girls, but a negative relationship was obtained between self-esteem and frequency of play in boys. However, self-esteem was not associated with total exposure to game play. Aggression scores were not related to the number of games with aggressive content named among three favourite games, but they were positively correlated with total exposure tu game play. A multiple regression analysis revealed that sex and total game play exposure each accounted for a significant but small amount of the variance in aggression scores. The positive correlation between playing computer games and aggression provides some justification for further investigation of the causal hypothesis, and possible methodologies are discussed.},

As an integral part of postmodern culture, science fiction has penetrated all fields of the media landscape: fiction, comic books, movies, even plays and musicals. Science fiction themes and images surface sometimes quite unexpectedly in everyday life, in TV commercials and video clips, not to speak of computer games. Internet enthusiasts use science fiction jargon and imagery to depict their visions of cyberspace. A generation ago, the race to the moon was at least partly inspired by the dreams of early science fiction writers and readers. For the public, technology is science fiction come true.

Eleven senior endoscopists were included in our study. Before the simulated endoscopies in GI Mentor II.

The results of the visuospatial tests were cot-related to the performance parameters of the virtual-reality endoscopy simulator. The percent of time spent with clear view in the simulated colonoscopy correlated well with the performance in the visuospatial PicSOr (r = -0.75, P = 0.01), card rotation (r = 0.75, P = 0.01), and cube comparison (r = 0.79, P = 0.004) tests. The endoscopists who performed better in the visuospatial tests also were better at maintaining visualization of the colon lumen. Those who performed better in the PicSOr test formed fewer loops during colonoscopy (r = 0.60, P = 0.05). In the technically less demanding simulated gastroscopy, there were no Such correlations. The visuospatial tests performed better in endoscopists not playing computer games. Good visuospatial ability correlates significantly with the performance of experienced endoscopists in a technically demanding simulated colonoscopy, but not in the less demanding simulated gastroscopy.},

Phase 2 included physiologic testing of wheelchair users and the GAME(Wheels) system to investigate whether the system elicits an exercise training response. Thirty-five subjects were recruited to evaluate the GAME(Wheels) by Flaying three commercial computer games (Phase 1) and to identify the computer game that they would prefer to use when exercising. The feedback from Phase 1 was used with test subjects to verify that the GAME(Wheels) system elicits an exercise training effect (Phase 2). Phase 2 included 10 subjects using the GAME(Wheels) system to play Need for Speed II. During game play, physiologic data were collected and the subjects\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} oxygen consumption and heart rate were analyzed.

The popularity of video games among youth may qualify them as a useful tool in psychotherapy for children and adolescents. Limited literature on use of video games in mental health care suggests that they can help young patients become more cooperative and enthusiastic about psychotherapy. Recent experience suggests that video games may facilitate therapeutic relationships, complement the psychological assessment of youth by evaluating cognitive skills, and elaborate and clarify conflicts during the therapy process. Concerns about video game content, perceived effects on youth, and lack of familiarity with this medium may form a barrier in their use in therapy offices. Further research on the benefits of video game use in psychotherapy, including patient characteristics that may moderate outcomes, is needed. Finally, future collaborations between clinicians and video game developers may produce specific games to be used in psychotherapy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Violent media exposure has been associated with aggressive behavior, and it has been suggested that child health professionals counsel families on limiting exposure. Effective violence prevention counseling requires an understanding of norms regarding parental attitudes, practices, and influencing factors. Both theories of reasoned action and planned behavior emphasize that subjective norms and attitudes affect people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s perceptions and intended behavior. Few data exist on violent television viewing and monitoring from a cross-section of families. By understanding the spectrum of parental attitudes, community-sensitive interventions for violence prevention can be developed. The objective of this study was to assess attitudes about and monitoring of violent television viewing from the perspective of parents.

METHODS: An anonymous self-report assisted survey was administered to a convenience sample of parents/guardians who visited child health providers at 3 sites: an urban children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s hospital clinic, an urban managed care clinic, and a suburban private practice. The parent questionnaire included questions on child-rearing attitudes and practices and sociodemographic information. RESULTS: A total of 1004 adults who accompanied children for health visits were recruited for the study; 922 surveys were completed (participation rate: 92\%). A total of 830 (90\%) respondents were parents and had complete child data. Of the 830 respondents, 677 had questions on television viewing included in the survey and were the focus of this analysis. Seventy-five percent of families reported that their youngest child watched television. Of these, 53\% reported always limiting violent television viewing, although 73\% believed that their children viewed television violence at least 1 time a week. Among television viewers, 81\% reported usually or always limiting viewing of sexual content on television and 45\% reported usually or always watching television with their youngest child. Among children who watched television, parents reported that they spent an average of 2.6 hours per day watching television. Limitation of television violence was associated with female parents and younger children. 

CONCLUSIONS: There was variability in attitudes and practices regarding television violence viewing and monitoring among parents. Attitudes and practices varied on the basis of the age of the child and the gender of the parent.},

The present research examined the similarities and differences between video game players (VGPs) and non-video game players (NVGPs) in terms of the ability to inhibit attention from returning to previously attended locations, and the efficiency of visual search in easy and more demanding search environments. Both groups were equally good at inhibiting the return of attention to previously cued locations, although VGPs displayed overall faster reaction times to detect targets. VGPs also showed overall faster response time for easy and difficult visual search tasks compared to NVGPs, largely attributed to faster stimulus-response mapping. The findings suggest that relative to NVGPs, VGPs rely on similar types of visual processing strategies but possess faster stimulus-response mappings in visual attention tasks. },

abstract = {Objective This study examined self-reported meal skipping and eating faster than usual with the goal of watching television or playing computer games. Method Respondents reported their media use and indicated how often they skipped a meal to watch a favourite television programme or to play a computer game, and how often they ate faster than usual in order to watch television or play a computer game. Subjects Respondents were 2546 adolescents of 13 (first year of secondary school) and 16 years (fourth year of secondary school) of age. Results About one respondent in 10 skipped at least one meal every week for either television viewing or computer game playing. Weekly meal skipping for television viewing occurs more regularly in boys and first-year students, but particularly in teenagers who view 5 h or more daily (15\% of the sample). The category of teenagers who play computer games four times a week or more (25.3\% of the sample) is at increased risk of meal skipping; those who play more than four times a week are 10 times more likely weekly to skip a meal. A quarter of the adolescents eat faster at least once a week to be able to watch television or play a computer game. Regardless of gender and school year, teenagers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} risk of eating faster progressively increases with their use of the media. Those who watch 4 h or more daily are about seven times more likely to skip a meal for television and those who play computer games at least four times a week are nine times more likely weekly to skip a meal. Conclusions Unhealthy eating habits can be a side effect of heavy or excessive media use. Teenagers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} use of television or game computers during nonworking or out-of-school hours partly displaces the amount of time that needs to be spent at meals. Practitioners and educators may try to encourage or restore a pattern of healthful meal consumption habits by reducing the amount of media use, and by supporting parental rule-making regarding children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s eating habits and media use.},

abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs) are now becoming a promising new technology to be used in the development of interactive learning environments for children. Perhaps triggered by the success of computer games, VEs are seen as an emergent and engaging new way by which children can learn experimental sciences and other disciplines. Inhabiting these IVEs can be agents or intelligent characters that are responsible for events that happen in the environment and make it not predictive or completely controlled. However, to build such environments, in particular, if populated by synthetic characters, one needs to carefully address the problem of how do the learners respond to the characters in the virtual environment. Do learners like the characters? Do learners identify themselves with characters in virtual environments? This relation between learners and characters in virtual environments can be studied in several perspectives. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the issue of empathy as one desirable aspect of the affective interaction between learners and synthetic characters. In particular, we will defend that in order for such affective relations to happen, characters should be created and designed taking into account what we call the proximity factor. This is based on the fact that children are found to respond more empathically to those that are perceived as similar to the self than those who are perceived as dissimilar (Barnett 1987). This appears to be the case when similarity is defined in terms of a shared characteristic, such as sex (Bryant 1982), race or in terms of shared personal experiences ( Bryant 1982). Thus, designing characters aiming at pedagogical empathic interactions, we should carefully address how close the learner will feel with the synthetic characters developed in terms of situation, behavior or even physical appearance. In order to illustrate this factor in eliciting emotional reactions to synthetic characters, we will present a specific system called FearNot!. FearNot! was developed to address the difficult and often devastating problem of bullying in schools. By using role-playing and synthetic characters in a 3D environment, FearNot! allows children from age 8 to 12 to experience a virtual scenario where they can witness ( in a third-person perspective) bullying situations. To build empathy into FearNot, we have considered the following components: agent\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s architecture, the characters\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} embodiment, the environment itself, and emotionally charged situations. All these elements were built to allow for a stronger proximity with the user and the system. In this paper, we will focus primarily on this problem and report some results achieved in the evaluation executed with 127 children and 95 adults on the system.},

abstract = {In spite of the benign nature of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), some show massive hemorrhage, rapid growth, and tumor recurrence. This led us to investigate the biological behavior, cell dynamics, and nobreak tumorigenesis of SEGAs. All patients (4 men and 3 women; age range, 6-27 years; mean, 13.6 years) had features of tuberous sclerosis complex and obstructive hydrocephalus. One patient had intratumoral bleeding. In two patients, sequential neuroimaging showed a subependymal nodule growing to become a SEGA. All underwent surgical resection without radiation therapy. One tumor recurred and was treated surgically. There were no postoperative deaths. The presence of cytologic atypia, mitoses and vascular proliferation had no implication in terms of the clinical course. MIB-1 labeling indices were low (mean, 0.9), indicating low proliferative potential. Unexpectedly, bcl-2 staining was sparse and bax staining predominated in majority of cases. However, the mean value of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling index was low. Immunohistochemically, tumors were positive for both glial and neuronal markers. In the majority of our cases, the expression of p53 was low. Only one tumor was focally positive for tuberin. SEGAs have low proliferative potential and apoptotic activity, and exhibit features of mixed glial- neuronal differentiation. In contrast to p53, tuberin is suggested to be the tumor suppressor in this tumor.},

Analysis of video game programming errors, design limitations, and rule ambiguities suggests a range of positive functions that glitches and cheats may perform. Glitches are software errors, either programming bugs or design flaws. Cheats are tricks for mastering games by circumventing the official rules for play. This article is based on the study of 751 glitches in 155 popular video games plus examination of web sites that disseminate cheats. It compares the standard computer science response to errors, which is to eliminate them, with a common video gamer response, which is to exploit them. The theoretical analysis contrasts games (in which victory is achieving set goals by following given rules) with metagames (in which victory is having the power to define the nature and rules of the game). Several related theoretical concepts are used to describe the complex subculture of video game players, for whom glitches and cheats are socially significant.},

abstract = {We propose a gaming architecture, called the Overlay Server System (OSS), for supporting multiparty online games over mobile networks. In OSS architecture, overlay server nodes (OSN) are distributed across the core network architecture of the mobile operator and each node is responsible for both running the game applications and performing the overlay routing. The architecture allows third party game servers that are located outside the core network of the mobile operator to push the execution of delay and bandwidth constrained game components into the core to achieve better quality of service (QoS). When a game consists of multiple mutually exclusive game objects such that each object can be maintained independently, OSS allows per object QoS optimization via selecting the jointly optimal location (i.e. OSN) and overlay routes for each object. This fine-grain optimization benefits most when different objects have different QoS requirements and they are accessed by different users. OSS dynamically adapts to the changes in game and network conditions by switching to better OSN and overlay routes. Our performance analysis on different core network topologies and usage patterns demonstrates that OSS has significant advantages over the alternative peer to peer (P2P), proxy-server, and client-server architectures. The analysis also underlines the individual contributions of object placement and jointly performed overlay route optimization to the performance gain.},

abstract = {We evaluated 22 patients with epileptic seizures in which the seizures were triggered by various games or game-related materials. Based on whether spontaneous seizure coexisted or not, these 22 patients were divided into two groups. Ten patients who experienced seizures exclusively while playing or watching specific games were referred to as Group 1, while 12 patients that had both game-induced and spontaneous seizures were classified as Group II. The patients in Group I had a middle-age onset (39.1 years) with a mate predominance (90\%). The electroencephalogram (EEG) or brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed non-specific abnormalities in 60\%, and the partial onset seizure was recognized in 30\% of patients. Antiepileptic drugs had uncertain benefits in this group. In Group II, patients had a mate predominance (67\%), with onset during adolescence (16.3 years). Most of them had generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures, and absences, and 42\% showed epileptiform discharge on EEG. These 12 patients were categorized into idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Although photosensitivity was an important factor, higher mental activity seemed to be significant precipitants of seizures in Group II. Antiepileptic drugs were necessary and valproic acid atone or combined with clonazepam was effective in this group. The results showed that game-related seizures are not a unique and homogeneous syndrome and may consist of different mechanisms. Teenage onset, coexistent spontaneous seizure, and associated idiopathic generalized epilepsies were crucial factors in the determination of antiepileptic drug therapy. Moreover, avoiding the related games altogether may be a more productive preventive measure. },

abstract = {Background: Pediatric sedation is of paramount importance but can be challenging. Fear and anticipatory anxiety before invasive procedures often lead to uncooperativeness. A novel device (PediSedate (R)) provides sedation through a combination of inhaled nitrous oxide and distraction (video game). We evaluated the acceptability and safety of the PediSedate (R) device in children. Methods: We enrolled children between 3 and 9 years old who were scheduled to undergo surgical procedures that required general inhalational anesthesia. After the device was applied, he/she played a video game while listening to the audio portion of the game through the earphones. Nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered via the nasal piece of the headset starting at 50\% and increasing to 70\%, in 10\% increments every 8 min. Treatment failures, vital signs, arterial oxygen saturation, depth of sedation, airway patency, side effects, acceptance of the device and parental satisfaction were all evaluated. Results: Of 100 children included, treatment failure occurred in 18\% mainly because of poor tolerance of the device. At least 96\% of the children who completed the study exhibited an excellent degree of sedation, 22\% had side effects, and none experienced serious airway obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were the most common side effects and no patients had hemodynamic instability. Conclusions: The PediSedate (R) device combines nonpharmacologic with pharmacologic methods of sedation. Most of the children we evaluated were able to tolerate the PediSedate (R) device and achieved an adequate degree of sedation.},

The two versions were exactly the same except that they were played by moving pieces either on a real board or on a virtual computer-presented board. The performance levels and strategies followed during the game by the 40 undergraduates who took part in the experiment were not significantly different in the real and virtual conditions. None of the participants transferred playing strategies or practice from one version of the game to the other. Scores were not affected by gender or by the studies pursued by participants, the habit of playing games in the traditional manner or playing video games, or intelligence. Retrospective reports did not support differences in the subjective experience between the two versions. Results showed that video games, when they do not make much use of the computer\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s special features, produce effects because of the situations they simulate rather than because of features of the computer itself.},

abstract = {MMOG are very large distributed applications, sharing very large states, and supporting communication between potentially thousands of player nodes. Despite the development of many solutions to define suitable architecture and communication protocol, and enabling efficient deployment of these types of applications, many issues remains which still require a solution. In this paper we discuss MMOG deployed over a Peer-to-Peer architecture, supporting a distributed model of systems with shared state and we address issues related to scalability, interest management and communication. We identify an efficient partitioning and distribution of the shared state as an important aspect in such models and propose a hierarchical multi-level interest management algorithm which enables contextual communication between peers. Experiments have been carried out and show the performance of the approach.

abstract = {This study analyzes the correlation between video game usage and academic performance. Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and grade-point average (GPA) scores were used to gauge academic performance. The amount of time a student spends playing video games has a negative correlation with students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} GPA and SAT scores. As video game usage increases, GPA and SAT scores decrease. A chi-squared analysis found a p value for video game usage and GPA was greater than a 95\% confidence level (0.005 < p < 0.01). This finding suggests that dependence exists. SAT score and video game usage also returned a p value that was significant (0.01 < p < 0.05). Chi-squared results were not significant when comparing time spent studying and an individual\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s SAT score. This research suggests that video games may have a detrimental effect on an individual\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s GPA and possibly on SAT scores. Although these results show statistical dependence, proving cause and effect remains difficult, since SAT scores represent a single test on a given day. The effects of video games maybe be cumulative; however, drawing a conclusion is difficult because SAT scores represent a measure of general knowledge. GPA versus video games is more reliable because both involve a continuous measurement of engaged activity and performance. The connection remains difficult because of the complex nature of student life and academic performance. Also, video game usage may simply be a function of specific personality types and characteristics.},

abstract = {Many designers, policy makers, teachers, and other practitioners are beginning to understand the usefulness of using digital games beyond entertainment. This has led to an increasing number of attempts to apply games meaningfully. Games have been developed from teaching students about history, making patients adhere in taking their medicine, to recruiting personnel for the military and collecting data to improve search engines. Yet, little is known on how to design such games. This book is one of the first to look into the fundamentals of designing any game with a serious purpose and provides a way of thinking on how to design one successfully.

Drawing on the personal design experience of the author as well as dozens of examples, the reader will be introduced to a design philosophy called \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}Triadic Game Design.\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} This argues that all games involve three worlds: the worlds of Reality, Meaning, and Play. Each world is affiliated with different people, disciplines, aspects, and criteria. The philosophy also posits that a balance needs to be found within and between the three worlds. Such a balance is difficult to achieve, during the design many tensions will arise, forcing designers to make trade-offs. To deal with these tensions and to ensure that the right decisions are made to create a harmonic game, a frame of reference is needed. This is what Triadic Game Design offers. And this is what makes it an invaluable tool for practitioners and researchers who are interested in using and designing games that have a real world impact.},

As we are better able to simulate the real world, we can usefully perform more research In simulated environments. The key aspects of a good simulator, an accurate physics simulation and realistic graphical rendering system, are also central to modern computer games. In this paper, we describe a robot simulation environment built from technologies typically used in computer video games. The simulator is capable of simulating multiple robots, with realistic physics and rendering. It can also support human-controlled avatars using a traditional first-person interface. This allows us to perform robot-human interaction and collaboration studies in the simulated environment. The distributed nature of the simulation allows us to perform large-scale experiments, with users participating from geographically remote locations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To report a series of children with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) whose urge syndrome was treated by electrical stimulation, and their voiding dysfunction by biofeedback; none of the children were using anticholinergic drugs during treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 36 children who presented with symptoms of urinary urgency and/or daily incontinence completed the treatment and were prospectively evaluated. The mean (range) follow-up was 13.8 (4-24) months, and their mean age 7 (3-14) years, 17 children were aged < 5 years. The children were divided into two groups: group 1, with urge syndrome treated with superficial parasacral electrical stimulation, and group 2, with voiding dysfunction, treated with biofeedback. RESULTS In group 1, the mean (range) number of electrical stimulation sessions was 13.1 (4-20). Of the 19 children treated, 12 had a complete clinical improvement, six a significant improvement, and one a mild improvement. In group 2, the mean (range) number of biofeedback sessions was 6 (4-14). Of the 17 children treated, there was complete improvement of symptoms in 10, significant improvement in two and mild improvement in five. Six children who had no resolution of symptoms after biofeedback had salvage therapy with electrical stimulation, after which four had complete improvement of symptoms, and two a 90\% and 40\% improvement, respectively. Taking the two groups together, after treatment, four children developed isolated episodes of urinary tract infection. Of 21 children with nocturnal enuresis, bed-wetting continued in 13 (62\%) after treatment. CONCLUSION In this short-term follow-up, the nonpharmacological treatment of voiding dysfunction using biofeedback, and of urge syndrome by electrical stimulation, was effective for treating LUTD in children.},

Although a less well-researched medium at this point, violent video and computer games (referred to simply as video games) may have particular impact because of their actively engaging, content-generating nature . Recent content analyses suggested that up to 90\% of all video games contain some sort of violent content, with at least half of these games including the potential for serious harm toward game characters . Such violent video games have become especially popular, even with relatively young children. In a recent survey of first through third graders, 53\% of the children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s favorite games had violent content, as rated by the children themselves (Jeanne Funk, PhD, Margaret Chan, unpublished data, 2004). In another recent survey of middle school volunteers, students listed and rated up to three favorite games using a list of six categories and descriptors developed with the help of children and adolescents and used in several previous studies. In that study, 99\% of boys and 84\% of girls categorized at least one of their current preferred video games as having violent content . The inescapable conclusion is that across childhood and adolescence and across gender, violent video games enjoy considerable popularity.},

Data from 98 independent studies with 36,965 participants revealed that for both violent video games and prosocial video games, there was a significant association with social outcomes. Whereas violent video games increase aggression and aggression-related variables and decrease prosocial outcomes, prosocial video games have the opposite effects. These effects were reliable across experimental, correlational, and longitudinal studies, indicating that video game exposure causally affects social outcomes and that there are both short- and long-term effects.},

abstract = {This paper compares supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms for the emergence of cooperative multiagent spatial coordination using a top-down approach. By observing the global performance of a group of homogeneous agents-supported by a nonglobal knowledge of their environment-we attempt to extract information about the minimum size of the agent neurocontroller and the type of learning mechanism that collectively generate high-performing and robust behaviors with minimal computational effort. Consequently, a methodology for obtaining controllers of minimal size is introduced and a comparative study between supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms for the generation of successful collective behaviors is presented. We have developed a prototype simulated world for our studies. This case study is primarily a computer games inspired world but its main features are also biologically plausible. The two specific tasks that the agents are tested in are the competing strategies of obstacle-avoidance and target-achievement. We demonstrate that cooperative behavior among agents, which is supported only by limited communication, appears to be necessary for the problem\&\#39;s efficient solution and that learning by rewarding the behavior of agent groups constitutes a more efficient and computationally preferred generic approach than supervised learning approaches in such complex multiagent worlds.

Using a national sample, this study gathered information about video-gaming habits and parental involvement in gaming, to determine the percentage of youth who meet clinical-style criteria for pathological gaming. A Harris poll surveyed a randomly selected sample of 1,178 American youth ages 8 to 18. About 8\% of video-game players in this sample exhibited pathological patterns of play. Several indicators documented convergent and divergent validity of the results: Pathological gamers spent twice as much time playing as nonpathological gamers and received poorer grades in school; pathological gaming also showed comorbidity with attention problems. Pathological status significantly predicted poorer school performance even after controlling for sex, age, and weekly amount of video-game play. These results confirm that pathological gaming can be measured reliably, that the construct demonstrates validity, and that it is not simply isomorphic with a high amount of play.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of computer gaming as a contemporary leisure activity, together with the use of PCs and games consoles as leisure technologies are evidence of the increasing convergence of new technology and leisure practice. The size and popularity of the games industry stands out in contrast to the lack of understanding of computer gaming as a serious leisure activity. Previous research on computer game playing has tended to focus on the negative aspects of gaming such as aggression, addiction, and social isolation, rather than viewing it as an activity which forms an important part of many people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s leisure lifestyles. This paper presents a very different image of gaming and gamers. It investigates computer gaming as a serious and competitive leisure activity. The paper looks at the gendered use and negotiation of leisure spaces by gamers in the context of the expansion of gaming into space and place outside the traditional domestic contexts and which blur boundaries between domestic and public leisure spaces. As such it assumes a perspective on computer gaming in which the activity is seen as part of the everyday leisure routines of gamers rather than a spectacular and notable stimulus or event. The paper argues that although certain aspects of computer gaming involve technological mediation and disembodiment, the changes in gaming texts and contexts have not radically improved the leisure constraints associated with gendered space and technologically-mediated activities. To this end, the paper draws on the existing gaming literature and preliminary ethnographic research of public competitive gaming.},

The paper will argue the opposite - that game-like features are, in fact, inappropriate to the design of applications systems and their user interfaces and are more effective in the design of computer-based training materials. Three main arguments are presented to support this: the cultural distinction between work and recreation, the transient motivational effect of games, and the differences in use of computer systems.},

Gender performances are discussed within the framework of four themes: the avatar; strategies; sexuality, and the contextual importance of WoW. Results show that gender identity construction in WoW is an ongoing process highly dependent on the social context of play. The women interviewed created gendered and sexualized identities constrained and empowered by the rules of the game and the opportunities it offers as well as of their social relations. Although a heterosexual norm rules, there are possibilities hitherto unrecognized for queer performance within the gendered role play in WoW and the game offers the possibility of multiple and alternative performances of the self.},

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if children would compensate for school days (9 a.m.-3 p.m.) of restricted physical activity opportunities by increasing activity levels after school (3 p.m.-7:30 p.m.). Third and fourth grade children (N = 76) each wore a CSA accelerometer of 4 nonconsecutive days. Two days were categorized as active-during school, all children participated in outdoor recess and physical education class. Two days were categorized as restricted-all children spent their recess time outdoors at a computer terminal, and no physical education class. Two days were categorized as restricted-all children spent their time indoors at a computer terminal, and no physical education class was scheduled. Dependent t tests revealed that children did not compensate for a sedentary school day by increasing their levels of physical activity after school. In fact, average movement counts per minute were higher in the 3 p.m.-7:30 p.m. following the active day (525 counts.min(-1)) versus the restricted day (186 counts.min(-1)). These findings suggest cause for concern if children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s opportunities to be active within school time are limited. Several reasons are given as to why children did not compensate or "make up" for the physical activity opportunities missed during the restricted school day.},

To explore gender identity and aggressive personality in the context of computers, an online survey was conducted on women who played computer games and women who used the computer but did not play computer games. Women who played computer games perceived their online environments as less friendly but experienced less sexual harassment online, were more aggressive themselves, and did not differ in gender identity, degree of sex role stereotyping, or acceptance of sexual violence when compared to women who used the computer but did not play video games.

Indeed, this domain has been affected by a continuous stream of technological advances on aspects ranging from physical infrastructures to mobile terminals. As a result, services for this domain are known to be very unpredictable and volatile. This situation is even worse when considering services relying heavily on multimedia activities (e.g., games, audio and/or video messages, etc.). Such an application area is very sensitive to a large variety of aspects such as terminal capabilities (graphics, CPU, etc.), bandwidth, service provider\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s billing policies, QoS, and user expectations. To address these issues, we present a paradigm based on domain-specific languages (DSLs) that enables networking and telecommunication experts to quickly develop robust communication services. Importantly, we propose implementation strategies to enable this paradigm to be supported by existing software infrastructures. Our DSL paradigm is uniformly used to develop a platform for communication services, named Nova. This platform addresses various domains of services including telephony services, e-mail processing, remote-document processing, stream processing, and HTTP resource adaption.},

Participation Analysis of Computer Gamers
in a convergent Media Culture
and taxonomy of ludic artefacts

This text thesis aims to examine media products which are produced by computer game players. Players approach these games in a non-trivial way and are part of cooperative and intensive communication project-communities. Within these communities they generate ludic artefacts in form of videos, images and real objects, produced out of games and by playing. Beginning with a very general discussion of the term game, the thesis continues with examining concepts of the computer game, web participation and convergent media culture. Additionally, a series of case studies is collected and described. The examinations lead to a taxonomy of ludic artefacts, which is divided into six main groups. Each of them contains further six subcategories, which explain the motivations for the production of such pieces of art, as well as different ways of using the medium computer game.

The proposal of this taxonomy of ludic artefacts aims to support the understanding of gamers who produce media artefacts, which transport and communicate the mental state and emotions of the gaming community. Convergent media culture, which incorporates participation of users and collective intelligence, enables a very special way of creativity. Thereby, the gamer is transformed into a prosumer and team player, who is able to articulate and express himself as an individual through these artefacts, travelling between the fields of popular culture and art. Therefore, the social type of the gamer is a co-creative representative of an avantgardistic gaming-, creation-, and networking-community, which uses the computer game as a platform and a creative programme.},

abstract = {Background: We have previously demonstrated the potential efficacy of a computer-assisted board game as a tool for medical education. The next logical step was to transfer the entire game on to the computer, thus increasing accessibility to students and allowing for a richer and more accurate simulation of patient scenarios. Methods: First, a general game model was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic. A breast module was then created using 3-D models, radiographs, and pathology and cytology images. The game was further improved by the addition of an animated facilitator, who directs the players via gestures and speech. Thirty-three students played the breast module in a variety of team configurations. After playing the game, the students completed surveys regarding its value as both an educational tool and as a form of entertainment. 10-question tests were also administered before and after playing the game, as a preliminary investigation into its impact on student learning, Results: After playing the game, mean test scores increased from 6.43 (SEM +/- 0.30) to 7.14 (SEM +/- 0.30; P = 0.006). The results of the five- question survey were extremely positive. Students generally agreed that the game concept has value in increasing general knowledge regarding the subject matter of breast disease and that the idea of following simultaneously the work-up of numerous patients with similar problems is a helpful way to learn a work-up algorithm. Conclusions: Postgame surveys demonstrate the efficacy of our computer game model as a tool for surgical education. The game is an example of problem based learning because it provides students with an initial set of problems and requires them to collect information and reason on their own in order to solve the problems. Individual game modules can be developed to cover material from different diagnostic areas. },

We concretely apply hybrid system theory and tools to model navigation strategies for virtual characters. In particular, we present hybrid systems for both low-level (local) and high-level (global) navigation strategies, and we describe how we modeled these systems using the hybrid system specification tool CHARON. Further, we directly employed our hybrid system models to generate animations that demonstrate these navigation strategies. Overall, our results suggest that hybrid systems may be a natural framework for modeling aspects of intelligent virtual actors. We also present a small verification example for a simple navigation strategy, and we briefly discuss obstacles to widespread practical applicability of verification in this problem domain.},

First, we wanted to know who the visitors of a LAN event were, because there is hardly any research available about this class of gamers. Second, we wanted to know why they participated in a LAN event. The survey showed that LAN gamers were almost exclusively male, with a mean age of 19.5 years. They devoted about 2.6 hours each day to gaming. They were motivated by social contact and a need to know more about games. The competition motive was third in the total sample. A subgroup of heavy gamers obtained a higher score on competition.

Study design: Nationally representative data from the 1996 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health of >14,000 US adolescents (including 3135 non-Hispanic blacks, 2446 Hispanics, and 976 Asians). Methods: Hours per week of inactivity (TV viewing, playing video or computer games) and times per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity were collected by using questionnaire data. Multinomial logistic regression models of physical activity and inactivity were used to adjust for sociodemographic factors. Results: Large ethnic differences are seen for inactivity, particularly for hours of television or video viewing per week (non-Hispanic blacks, mean = 20.4; non-Hispanic whites, mean = 13.1). Physical activity (greater than or equal to 5 bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, 5-8 metabolic equivalents) is lowest for female and minority adolescents. Ethnic differences are far greater for inactivity than for moderate to vigorous physical activity. Conclusion: Minority adolescents, with the exception of Asian females, have consistently higher levels of inactivity. Results vary by sex; males have higher inactivity and physical activity, whereas lowest physical activity is found for non-Hispanic black and Asian females, although Asian females also have low inactivity and low levels of overweight. Overall, efforts to reduce the problem of adolescent overweight should focus on increasing activity levels of adolescents, particularly female, older, and major minority subpopulations.},

abstract = {Objectives To describe mass media use in teenagers (television, mobile phones, computers, Internet and video games) and to analyze its influence on teenagers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} health and development. Material and methods We performed a cross sectional study by means of a survey of 884 teenagers aged between 14 and 18 years old who were in the third and fourth years of high school in six towns in Cantabria (Spain) in June 2003. The statistical analysis consisted of uni- and bivariable descriptive statistics. Results All the teenagers had a television set at home and 24\% of families had four or more television sets. The presence of distinct mass media in teenagers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} rooms was 52.5\% for televisions, 57.8\% for computers, 52\% for the Internet and 38.7\% for games consoles. The most frequently found media in teenagers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} bedrooms were radio/cassette players and compact disks with 76.8\% and 67.4\%, respectively. Teenagers watched television for an average of 3 hours per day on weekdays and 3.2 hours per day at weekends. They played games consoles for an average of 0.69 hours per day on weekdays (41 min) and an average of 1.09 hours per day (65 min) at weekends and used the Internet on weekdays for an average of 0.83 hours per day (49 min) and an average of 1.15 hours per day (69 min) at weekends. A total of 87.2\% of the teenagers, especially girls, had a mobile phone (91.6\% of girls versus 82.4\% of boys; p < 0.001). The average age at which teenagers had the first mobile phone was 13 years old. Expenditure on mobile phones amounted to 15 (sic) a month in girls and 10 (sic) a month in boys, and mobiles were mainly used for sending messages. Nearly half the teenagers (46.4\%) took their mobile phones to high school and reported they had an average of three mobile phones at home. Most (82.1\%) surfed the net but boys preferred surfing and downloading games and girls preferred chatting and sending e-mails. Sixty-two percent of teenagers had been to a cybercafe and 40.8\% has visited a pornographic web site, especially boys (33.1\% of boys versus 7.7\% of girls; p < 0.001). Nearly two-thirds of teenagers (71.5\%) had a video console, especially boys (87\% of boys versus 57.2\% of girls; p < 0.001) and they started playing with them at an average age of 8.8 years. Boys preferred video games with shooting, fights, sports and driving, while girls preferred adventure video games. Nearly a quarter (22.2\%) spent money on video games and cybercafes (an average of 27.06 (sic) a month in boys and 16.81 (sic) a month in girls) with no significant differences between sexes. Conclusions Society as a whole and especially health professionals should increase health education on mass media consumption, by stimulating reasonable use of mass media and teaching teenagers to be critical. Parents should set a limit of less than 2 hours/day to the use of mass media and should avoid their presence in teenagers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} bedrooms. Prepay mobile phone should be used and switched off in inappropriate places. Parents should supervise and educate teenagers about video games, Internet access and e-mail usage in adolescence.},

abstract = {In the problematic exploration of the narrative potential of videogames, one of the clearest aspects that bridge stories and games is space. This paper examines the different devices that videogames have used to incorporate stories through spatial design and what is known as environmental storytelling, focusing on the design elements that make the story directly relevant to gameplay beyond world-building and backstory exposition. These design-related elements are accounted for with the term indexical storytelling. As a refinement of the concept of environmental storytelling, indexical storytelling is a productive game design device, since reading the space of the game and learning about the events that have taken place in it are required to traverse the game successfully. Storytelling becomes a game of story-building, since the player has to piece together the story, or construct a story of her own interaction in the world by leaving a trace.},

abstract = {Gender-inclusivity in games has been a much debated issue and despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. One of the challenges in designing a more gender-inclusive game is how to define gender-inclusivity in games. By gender-inclusivity in games, we refer to any component that characterizes a situation related to gameplay, content and genre of a game. A gender-inclusive game promises richer and balanced games for both male and female gamers but the current state of research in this field is still far removed from that potential. This is due to three gaps in game design: (1) the notion of gender-inclusivity in games is still ill-defined; (2) there is a lack of conceptual framework to support the design of a gender-inclusive game; and (3) lack of tools to support the development of a gender-inclusive game.

In this paper, we address these needs in turn through a generic framework, Gender-Inclusivity Framework (GIF). We first define gender-inclusivity in games, identify components of gender-inclusivity content and characterize gender-inclusivity in games behaviour. In conclusion, we outline how such a framework can be used to support the investigation of research in the area of gender-inclusivity in games.},

abstract = {This article reviews the literature on the relations between anonymity in antisocial behaviour: does online anonymity qualitatively alter online behaviour, encouraging antisocial behaviour online? Or does online anonymity have no effect on the exhibition of antisocial behaviour? I argue that this line of thought presents an unsatisfactory dichotomy as it does not sufficiently account for individual contexts. Anonymity alone is not adequate to induce antisocial behaviour: it requires the motivation to act in that manner. I argue that the development of this motivation to exhibit antisocial behaviour involves a multifaceted perspective that consolidates the self (e.g. socio-economic backgrounds and the degree of value placed on anonymity) with the other (e.g. group norms). This is, in turn, influenced by the chosen media channel (e.g. games, forums, virtual worlds, chat-rooms), the presence of any wider motivations (political and sociological), and the degree of anonymity afforded by the media channel; these factors affect the way anonymity is perceived and utilised.},

abstract = {Collaborative (or cooperative) games became very popular over the recent years. Aside from being received well by players, great collaborative games also offer the potential to train their players’ ability to work in teams. However, some other games include additional players without adapting their design appropriately, which may lead to games where the players hardly interact with each other and with little to none benefit when another player is present. This paper aims to improve this situation by introducing game design patterns for collaborative player interactions. Being extracted from well-received games, these patterns can be used as guidance for collaborative game designs fostering interaction between players. The interactions are classified along several dimensions (e.g. spatial and temporal) and can therefore be easily selected for specific situations. An example game design where some of these patterns were applied is also described.},

abstract = {Autonomous synthetic characters have the potential to promote the social engagement of users in virtual environments, enhancing their interaction experience. In computer games, for example, poor interaction with game characters can drastically detract from the gaming experience, making the design of autonomous synthetic characters an important issue. In particular, in Role Playing Games (RPGs), for example, users and autonomous characters often perform in a group. Usually, the role of such characters is very limited since they lack the social skills to perform coherently in group scenarios.The goal of the work presented here is to endow autonomous synthetic characters with social skills that allow them to perform in groups with human members. However, to successfully achieve this, it is not enough to assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective or that they are able to perform the group task optimally. It is also necessary that the autonomous characters exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s composition, context and structure.For this reason, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of autonomous synthetic characters (SGD model) inspired by theories developed in human social psychological sciences. This model defines the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. The model was used in a collaborative computer game that was tested with users. The results showed that the model had a positive effect on the users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} social engagement, namely. on their trust and identification with the group. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In trying to understand user experience in interactive technologies such as computer games and virtual environments, reliable and valid concepts are needed for measuring relevant user reactions and experiences. Here we present our approach to create both theoretically and methodologically sound methods for quantification of the rich user experience in different digital environments. Our approach is based on the idea that the experience received from a content presented with a specific technology is always a result of a complex psychological interpretation process, which components should be understood. The main aim of our approach is to grasp the complex and multivariate nature of the experience and make it measurable. We will present our two basic measurement frameworks, which have been developed and tested in large data set (n=2182). The 15 measurement scales extracted from these models are applied to digital gaming with a head-mounted display and a table-top display. The results show how it is possible to map between experience, technology variables and the background of the user (e.g., gender). This approach can help to optimize, for example, the contents for specific viewing devices or viewing situations.},

The results confirmed that digital game violence was directly associated with direct aggression, especially at age 10, but only among boys. The moderating role of social intelligence was substantiated among older boys: game violence was associated with indirect aggression among those with high level of social intelligence. Further, as hypothesized, digital game playing was associated with direct aggression especially when parent-child communication was poor, but only among boys. Our findings emphasize the importance of individual and situational factors as moderators of the link between game violence and aggression.

abstract = {Factors currently affecting the use of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) include limitations on access due to the; lack of therapists, the cost involved and the reluctance of patients. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends Computerized CBT (CCBT) as a way of tackling these problems. A number oil attempts have been made to use computer games as a specific therapeutic tool. Most of these have been directed at older age ranges and those with good reading skills. Our work is in the development of a computer game to be used specifically in the treatment of young children (8-12 years) who are exhibiting behavioural disorders. The children in the target group are experiencing a range of emotional problems with various causes. The children have specific needs and behaviours which affect the way in which they will interact with games. The design of this game has involved us in a long term ethnographic study of the children during their treatment and experiments involving two groups of children playing a number of computer games. These studies have enabled us to determine the nature of the game and to establish how the children interact with computers, the types of games they would relate to and the levels of complexity they could cope with. Most of the children come from deprived backgrounds with low academic achievement but have a relatively high exposure to computer games and "sophisticated" tastes. The results of the study and further research including interviews with therapists have informed the design of the game. One crucial factor has been the inclusion of psycho-education principles in the design. In common with most other CBT games it is a role-play game with a set of tasks. However, from our study we can see that the interfaces provided by most current CBT games would have a limited appeal - being too simplistic in some ways but requiring too large a vocabulary for the target group of children. Providing a sophisticated interface but where a limited level of reading is needed has proved an important factor in the design. In addition the player is given the ability to design his or her own character to improve identification. A "conscience" character - the magical do better - who has qualities determined by the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s chosen character accompanies the player.},

abstract = {This article explores the construction of Silent Hill--Konami\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s survival horror video game series--as art. Adopting a discursive approach to the notion of "art," the extent to which traditional formations of cultural value are mobilized is explored across three aspects of the series\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} first four installments. The Silent Hill game texts are examined as evoking formal devices of art cinema, including realism, ambiguity, psychological complexity, and self-reflexivity. Next the games\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} advertising is considered as emphasizing these qualities, privileging narrative over ludic gaming aspects. Finally the games\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} representation in the documentary "The Making of Silent Hill 2" is discussed as positioning the series within frameworks of artistry and authorship.},

abstract = {In this article, I argue that the first-person shooter video game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, reflects the U.S. military’s transition as it reimagines the soldier’s role in war. In the age of drone technology, this role shifts from a position of strength to one of relative weakness. Although video games that feature future combat often “function as virtual enactments and endorsements for developing military technologies,” Black Ops II offers a surprisingly complex vision of the future of drones and U.S. soldiers (Smicker 2009: 107). To explore how the game reflects a contemporary vision of the U.S. military, I weave together a close textual reading of two levels in Black Ops II with actual accounts from drone pilots and politicians that illuminate the nature of drone combat. Although there are moments in Black Ops II in which avatars combat enemies with first-hand firepower, the experience of heroic diegetic violence is superseded by a combat experience defined by powerlessness, boredom, and ambiguous pleasure. The shift of the soldier from imposing hero to a banal figure experiences its logical conclusion in Unmanned, an independent video game that foregrounds the mundane, nonviolent nature of drone piloting. Instead of training soldiers to withstand emotionally devastating experiences of death and violence first-hand (or to physically enact such violence), games like Black Ops II and Unmanned train actual and potential soldiers to tolerate monotony and disempowerment.},

In order to control the motions of the fish interactively as in computer games, we attempted to learn the motion properties of the fish in this video sequence. Some of the motion parameters of the fish were extracted from the video frames and then trained using a neural network. This trained information provided motion control for generating fish animation. In the proposed system, we also generate arbitrary video loop lengths for rendering and animating fish. It is not necessary that the video samples in these video loops be played in sequence. Furthermore, we can adapt both the video loop and neural network techniques in order to control the fish motions interactively and to maintain visual smoothness in fish animation.},

We explore parodic resistance empirically by analyzing Festivus, a parody of Christmas. Festi- vus is found to be primarily constructed as a playful rejection of the established grand narratives and conventions of Christmas. In contrast to dominant Christmas ideology, Festivus promotes a grand narrative of “meaningful nothingness,” wherein Festivus celebration is presented a viable means of circumventing the oppressiveness of Christmas (i.e. “meaningful”) through erasing the higher goals and conventions if Christmas (i.e. “nothingness”). Our contribution is threefold: (i) we demonstrate the role of parody in consumer resistance; (ii) we outline the subversively playful nature of parodic consumer resistance; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate how parodic holiday celebration unsettles dominant discourses and conventions.},

abstract = {The mechanisms through which stress may contribute to the racial difference in the prevalence of essential hypertension and associated target organ damage remain unclear. This study examined differences in stress-induced pressure natriuresis in 69 black and 52 white normotensives age 14 to 27 years, all with a positive family history of hypertension. Urine samples for sodium excretion were collected before and after a series of tasks (video game challenge, forehead cold stimulation). The average blood pressure across the 2 tasks and the average increase in blood pressure to the 2 tasks were calculated. Blacks had higher mean systolic (131 +/- 12 versus 126 +/- 12 min Hg, P < 0.02) and diastolic (77 +/- 8 versus 72 +/- 9 mm Hg, P < 0.001) blood pressure and a greater average change in systolic blood pressure (15 +/- 9 versus 11 +/- 7 mmHg, P < 0.04). This was associated with a smaller change in sodium excretion (2 +/- 6 versus 7 +/- 10 mEq/h P < 0.002). The change in sodium excretion was related to the change in systolic (r = 0.31, P < 0.03) and diastolic (r = 0.27, P < 0.05) blood pressure in whites but not in blacks. Relative wall thickness was greater in blacks (0.31 +/- 0.04 versus 0.29 +/- 0.03, P < 0.002). In conclusion, impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis in blacks may contribute to racial differences in essential hypertension and its sequelae.},

Mass-produced toys and games shape children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s behaviors, and the fire images on toy packaging may send the message that fire is fun rather than dangerous. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of male fire-related injuries at our burn center and to investigate the use of fire images in toy packaging. An aisle-by-aisle search was conducted at a national toy store. Toys with fire images on their packaging were identified. Target gender and the setting in which the fire was displayed also were recorded. Only toys with clearly visible flames on their packaging were included. We reviewed our TRACS database from April 1997 to May 1999 for fire-related injuries to children admitted to our institution as a result of playing with fire. Review of toy stores revealed 404 toys with packaging containing fire images. Of these, 97\% (393 of 404) were targeted to males. Video games were the leading category of flame-related packaging (208 of 404), followed by toy car/truck displays (84 of 404). Packaging for girls\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} toys had safe and contained settings, whereas boys\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} toys used settings that were uncontrolled and associated with speed and weapons. A total of 59 children, 52 males and 7 females, with a mean age of 10 +/- 0.6 years and mean TBSA burn of 12.3 +/- 2.1\% were admitted to our facility with fire-related injuries during the study interval. Children imitate life with toys and use play to experiment with new behavior. Boys are receiving a powerful, consistent message from images of fire on toy packaging. These advertisements may help to contribute to the higher incidence of fire-related injuries in boys.},

By contrast, the process of localizing productivity applications follows a relatively well-defined set of guidelines, with which many technical communicators are familiar. The localization processes for digital games, however, can follow one of three levels of complexity, none of which are formally articulated. In this article, we focus on the most challenging and most potentially effective form of digital game localization, known as blending. Blending involves the alteration of the central storyline of a game to make the game more successful in other countries. We believe that technical and professional communicators should learn more about blending, digital game localization, and their place within the burgeoning game industry.

This paper describes an empirical study that looks at physical gaming and how it finds its place in the home. We discuss the findings from this study by organizing them around four topics: the adoption of the game, its unique spatial needs, the tension between visibility and availability of the game, and what it means to play among what we describe as the gaming circle, or players and non-players alike. Finally, we discuss how physical gaming in the home surfaces questions and issues for householders and researchers around adoption, gender and both space and place.

We conducted an exploratory Internet survey ( n 5 751) in order to gather information about who the players of online first person shooters are, and why they spend time on playing this particular kind of video game. The results of our survey on the one hand confirmed the stereotype of the gamer as it is often presented in popular media: the players of online FPS were indeed almost exclusively young men ( mean age about 18 years) who spend a lot of their leisure time on gaming ( about 2.6 h per day). We also found that the most committed gamers, that is, the ones who were members of a ( semi) professional clan, scored highest on motives with respect to competition, and challenge in comparison with members of amateur clans and online gamers who had not joined a clan. On the other hand, our results cast doubt on the accuracy of the stereotype. This study showed clearly that online FPSG are not played in isolation. More than 80\% of our respondents were member of a clan. Also, the regression analysis showed that the social interaction motive was the strongest predictor of the time actually spend on gaming.},

abstract = {Background: Although considerable research suggests that health-risk factors vary as a function of video-game playing among young people, direct evidence of such linkages among adults is lacking.Purpose: The goal of this Study was to distinguish adult video-game players from nonplayers on the basis of personal and environmental factors. It was hypothesized that adults who play video games, compared to nonplayers, would evidence poorer perceptions of their health, greater reliance on Internet-facilitated social support, more extensive media use, and higher BMI. It was further hypothesized that different patterns of linkages between video-game playing and health-risk factors would emerge by gender.Methods: A cross-sectional, Internet-based survey was conducted in 2006 with a sample of adults from the Seattle-Tacoma area (n=562), examining health risks; media use behaviors and perceptions, including those related to video-game playing; and demographics. Statistical analyses conducted in 2008 to compare video-game players and nonplayers included bivariate descriptive statistics, stepwise discriminant analysis, and ANOVA.Results: A total of 45.1\% of respondents reported playing video games. Female video-game players reported greater depression (M=1.57) and poorer health status (M=3.90) than female nonplayers (depression, M=1.13; health status, M=3.57). Male video-game players reported higher BMI (M=5.31) and more Internet use time (M=2.55) than male nonplayers (BMI, M=5.19; Internet use, M=2.36). The only determinant common to female and male video-game players was greater reliance on the Internet for social support.Conclusions: A number of determinants distinguished video-game players from nonplayers, and these factors differed substantially between men and women.

abstract = {In this article we discuss the role that the physicality of dice has in the experience of the non-digital tabletop strategy game Warhammer 40,000. Numerous previous approaches towards the digital augmentation of non-digital games have considered dice rolling a menial or tedious computational task to be designed away. We disagree. In this article we argue that the physicality of dice has a positive effect on players’ experience and enjoyment of the game. This occurs through their tangibility, their role as a representational object (situationally, imaginatively and audibly), and through enabling shared experiences. Thus, while digital augmentation of physical games has the potential to make strong contributions to game play experiences, more careful consideration should be given to what might be lost through such efforts.},

abstract = {Recent high-performance ray tracing implementations have already achieved interactive performance on a single PC even for highly complex scenes. However, so far these approaches have been limited to mostly static scenes due to the high cost of updating the necessary spatial index structures after modifying scene geometry. In this paper, we present an approach that avoids these updates almost completely for the case of skinned models as typically used in computer games. We assume that the characters are built from meshes with an underlying skeleton structure, where the set of joint angles defines the character\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s pose and determines the skinning parameters. Based on a sampling of the possible pose space we build a static fuzzy kd-tree for each skeleton segment in a fast preprocessing step. This fuzzy kd-tree is then organized into a top-level kd-tree. Together with the skeleton\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s affine transformations this multi-level kd-tree allows fast and efficient scene traversal at runtime, while arbitrary combinations of animation sequences can be applied interactively to the joint angles. We achieve a real-time ray tracing performance of up to 15 frames per second at 1024x1024 resolution even on a single processor core.},

abstract = {The importance of information and communication technology (ICT) in our daily lives is growing. To prepare future employees to this evolving environment, technology should play a role in education. Furthermore, computer technology serves as a valuable and supportive tool to improve teaching and learning and allows new types of teaching and learning experiences to evolve. For instance, the concept of digital games-based learning (DGBL) has been growing for many years now. In order to prepare the next generation of teachers according to the image of society, teachers must be adequately trained.In this article, the authors describe the design, implementation and evaluation of two courses on digital games-based learning (DGBL) developed for the pre-service teacher training programme in health education in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium). Both courses were set up as an introduction to digital games and gaming for learning and instruction. The objective was to provide an opportunity for students to explore (i) the possibilities, considerations and constraints related to the design of digital instructional games, and (ii) the practical design and try-out of a game in classroom settings using standard or free software (such as Excel, Hot Potatoes, JClic). Results show that the games\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} inclusion in the formal curriculum encouraged them in using GBL in their future teaching activities and enables them to engage their supervising teachers into using games in their classrooms.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Prior research has demonstrated that counterintuitive laparoscopic surgical skills are enhanced by experience with video games. A similar relation with robotic surgical skills has not been tested. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prior video-game experience enhances the acquisition of robotic surgical skills. Subjects and Methods: A series of 242 preclinical medical students completed a self-reported video-game questionnaire detailing the frequency, duration, and peak playing time. The 10 students with the highest and lowest video-game exposure completed a follow-up questionnaire further quantifying video game, sports, musical instrument, and craft and hobby exposure. Each subject viewed a training video demonstrating the use of the da Vinci surgical robot in tying knots, followed by 3 minutes of proctored practice time. Subjects then tied knots for 5 minutes while an independent blinded observer recorded the number of knots tied, missed knots, frayed sutures, broken sutures, and mechanical errors. Results: The mean playing time for the 10 game players was 15,136 total hours (range 5,840-30,000 hours). Video-game players tied fewer knots than nonplayers (5.8 v 9.0; P = 0.04). Subjects who had played sports for at least 4 years had fewer mechanical errors (P = 0.04), broke fewer sutures (P = 0.01), and committed fewer total errors (P = 0.01). Similarly, those playing musical instruments longer than 5 years missed fewer knots (P = 0.05). Conclusions: In the extremes of video-game experience tested in this study, game playing was inversely correlated with the ability to learn robotic suturing. This study suggests that advanced surgical skills such as robotic suturing may be learned more quickly by athletes and musicians. Prior extensive video-game exposure had a negative impact on robotic performance.},

Using advanced gaming technology for leadership skills acquisition has been the subject of a debate over the last decade. The benefits of \&quot;soft skills\&quot; games have been repeatedly highlighted in literature, mostly illustrating success stories of business education programs. Due to the fragmented nature of research on game-based training, the movement towards using games for soft and higher-order skills training for military leadership has been relatively cautious. Nevertheless, the need to provide modern leadership with effective training opportunities continues to drive innovation within the simulation and training industry. Critical thinking and problem-solving skills remain some of the most challenging areas of higher-order skills training. This paper discusses an experimental approach of using advanced gaming technology to develop instructional simulations to teach these skills to the Navy leadership. Special attention is paid to the discussion of the design and development issues as well as the challenges of ensuring the knowledge transfer.

We present a simple game that exhibits functionality found in commercial games (animation, collision detection, etc.) and show how it can be used as a case study for design patterns. Specifically, we illustrate how the state, facade, observer, strategy, and visitor patterns can replace procedural approaches for implenting the logic and animation of game written in Java.

abstract = {This article examines the cultural fabric of national identity in light of recent debates in the human sciences on the nature of texts and “textual realities.” In discussing various political and historical examples, it argues that conceiving of national identity as a “textual reality” is to understand it (a) as a symbolic construction, (b) as a process of continuous cultural interpretation and reinterpretation, (c) as semiotic mediation, and (d) as a heterogeneous composition of different, often contradictory, layers of meaning. Although these issues have been discussed in different disciplines and theoretical contexts, they are viewed here as aspects of the same phenomenon, reflecting, each in its way, the conceptual scope of the textual approach. In further developing this argument, the article outlines a concept of text that covers not only linguistic phenomena in the traditional sense but also meaningful structures in a larger, cultural sense: symbolic spaces that embrace several semiotic media. Based on the idea of text as a symbolic space, a concept of national identity is suggested that, although it implies viewing identity as a discursive and narrative construction, is not limited to the mode of linguistic storytelling but also includes narrative media such as architecture, landscape design, cultural traditions such as commemorative rituals, and other symbolic and material practices.},

Instantaneous game events elicited reliable psychophysiological responses indexing valence and arousal. A largely linear, positive dose-response relationship between rewards obtained in the game and phasic increases in arousal was revealed. The valence of the emotional response varied as a function of the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s active participation (active coping). In addition, not only positive events, but also some putatively negative events elicited positively valenced arousal.

@article{Anderson2003,
abstract = {Research on violent television and films, video games, and music reveals unequivocal evidence that media violence increases the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior in both immediate and long-term contexts. The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of violence are also substantial (r = .13 to .32) when compared with effects of other violence risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community (e.g., effect of aspirin on heart attacks). The research base is large; diverse in methods, samples, and media genres; and consistent in overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film violence. The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions. Short-term exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated assault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence. Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal, and triggering an automatic tendency to imitate observed behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisition of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts, interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior, and by reducing individuals\&\#39; normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desensitization). Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental influences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the perpetrator) can influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression, but there are some inconsistencies in research results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpretation, and control of children\&\#39;s media use). However, extant research on moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Although it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield beneficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by themselves are unsuccessful. Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psychological processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most severe types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the scientific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-violence exposure to children and youth.

Evolutionary approaches to game artificial intelligence (game AI) have produced successful results for complex game winning strategies, realistic behavior patterns for groups of simulated entities, and more. However, there has been relatively little effort on evolutionary techniques for producing rich NPC behaviors for interaction with human players. To explore whether evolutionary mechanisms can support real-time control of NPCs to produce flexible and purposeful behavior, we present our initial efforts at integrating a genetic algorithm based robotic controller with an off-the-shelf game to control one or more NPCs dynamically. We describe the integration effort and our initial observations, and discuss our plan for achieving richer NPC control and for performing more detailed analysis of the behaviors of the resulting NPCs.

@article{Ryan2006,
abstract = {This essay explores how theoretical physics, narratology, and narrative itself deal with the idea that reality consists of a plurality of worlds. In physics, the existence of parallel universes has been postulated on the cosmic level to describe what lies on the other side of black holes and, on the level of subatomic particles, to avoid the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. In narratology, the philosophical idea of a plurality of possible worlds and the contrast between the actual and the possible provide amodel of the cognitive pattern into which readers organize information in order to interpret it as a story. But the many-worlds interpretation of physics and the possible worlds (PW) model of narrative differ in their conception of the onto- logical status of the multiple worlds: in physics they are all actual, while narrative theory stresses the contrast between actuality and mere possibility. This does not mean that the PW model is incompatible with themany-worlds cosmology proposed by physics: faced with a narrative that presents multiple realities as existing objec- tively, the theory would simply claim that the actual domain is made up of a number of differentworlds and that the distinction actual/nonactual repeats itself within each of these parts.The last section of the essay explores what it takes for a narrative to impose a many-worlds cosmology, distinguishing these narratives from other texts that present contradictory versions of facts and situating them with respect to three types of story common in fantasy and science fiction: the narrative of transworld exploration, the narrative of alternate history, and the time-travel narrative.},

Next, we will see how it was received by the Spectrum and Amstrad game community and how it is still highly valued by retro video game enthusiasts today. We will look at four reasons for the popularity of Head Over Heels given by the designers and the game community and propose two more, i.e. its interactive layout and its semantics. In the theoretical interlude we will go deeper into the history and nature of the concepts of "immersion" and "interactivity" in recent digital cultural theory. Finally, we will zoom in on the interactive framework of Head Over Heels using the concepts and theory sketched before, and attempt to substantiate the claim that signification plays a role in the appreciation and reception of interactive media objects. \{$\backslash$textcopyright\} 2001-2004 Game Studies.},

Second, such creative misuse creates a particular embodied relationship to surveillance, what I term the “sensory-inscribed body.” Ultimately, the sensory-inscribed body, through creative misuse of locative tracking technologies, demonstrates that surveillance space is not statically inscribed with meaning; instead, the meanings emerge through practice. Playful engagement reinscribes the possible meanings, positioning the embodied player not simply as an object of surveillance but instead as a creative misuser who brings together heterogeneous elements to reconfigure spatial relationships between people and surveillance technologies.},

Research has shown that it can have positive effects on people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s behavior, attitudes, knowledge, and interpersonal communication. It works with various media (products) such as radio, TV soap operas, street theatre, or comics. The question is whether this strategy also works for computer games. To test this, an entertainment education computer game about HIV/AIDS education was developed. The computer game led to a significant increase in knowledge about HIV/AIDS, but no increases in interest and communication could be observed. Possible explanations and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {The question/answer-based computer game Age of Computers was introduced to replace traditional weekly paper exercises in a course in Computer Fundamentals in 2003. Questionnaire evaluations and observation of student behavior have indicated that the students found the game more motivating than paper exercises and that a majority of the students also perceived the game to have a higher learning effect than paper exercises or textbook reading. This paper reports on a controlled experiment to compare the learning effectiveness of game play with traditional paper exercises, as well as with textbook reading. The results indicated that with equal time being spent on the various learning activities, the effect of game play was only equal to that of the other activities, not better. Yet this result is promising enough, as the increased motivation means that students work harder in the course. Also, the results indicate that the game has potential for improvement, in particular with respect to its feedback on the more complicated questions.},

abstract = {A study was undertaken to analyse the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) and confounding factors in primary school children in the city of Antwerp. A total of 392 children aged 9 were included in the study. All children completed a validated three-page questionnaire and they all underwent a specific lumbar spine oriented medical examination during their annual routine medical school control. This examination was performed by the city school doctors. The questionnaire was composed of easy "yes/no" questions and visual analogue scales. Statistical analysis was performed using Student\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s t-test and chi-squared test at the significance level P < 0.05. The prevalence of LBP was high. No gender difference was found. A total of 142 children (36\%) reported having suffered at least one episode of LBP in their lives. Of these, 33 (23\%) had sought medical help fur LBP from a doctor or physiotherapist. Sixty-four percent of children reporting LBP said that at least one of their parents suffered from or complained of LBP. This was significantly higher than for the children who did not report having suffered LBP. The way in which the school satchel was carried (in the hand, on the back) had no bearing on the incidence of LBP. There was significantly more LBP in children who reported playing video games for more than 2 h per day, but this was not so for television watchers. The visual analogue scales concerning general well-being were all very significantly correlated with self-reported LBP, with children who reported LBP being more tired, less happy, and worse sleepers. Of the 19 clinical parameters taken down during the medical examination, only one was significantly more prevalent in the group of children reporting LBP: pain on palpation at the insertion site on the iliac crest of the iliolumbar ligament. From this study we can establish that there are few clinical signs that can help to single out school children with LBP.},

It also ensures a better level of quality for the final product, given the fact that an important fraction of the application is already found within the framework and has therefore already been tested. This case study takes the systematic generation of hot-spot subsystems approach as a reference point to describe the underlying concepts in the design of a framework for the development of 2D action videogames for low-performance machines. The main goal of this paper is to show the applicability of framework-based reuse to videogames. Both standard and framework-based game implementations are compared and the results are analysed. Special attention is paid to the (potential) benefits that the use of frameworks brings to the fulfillment of maintenance tasks along the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s life cycle, a stage that normally consumes most resources in software projects. At the end of the paper, based on the implementation results, this study shows the predicted conditions under which building a framework is cost effective for the development of videogames similar to the ones from the studied domain.},

abstract = {This study investigates the influence of a first-person perspective (1PP) and a third-person perspective (3PP), respectively, on the affective appraisal and on the user engagement of a three-dimensional virtual environment in SECOND LIFE. Participants explored the environment while searching for five targets during a limited time span, using either a 1PP or a 3PP. No significant overall effect was found for viewing perspective on the appraisal of the three-dimensional virtual environment on the dimensions of arousal and valence. However, a 3PP yields more perceived control over the avatar and the events, which is a requirement for engagement. Analysis of the performance on the search task shows that participants using a 3PP find more objects but also need more time to find them. The present results suggest that a 3PP conveys a more distinct impression of the environment, thereby increasing engagement, and probably induces a different viewing strategy. Hence, a 3PP appears preferable for simulation and training applications in which the correct assessment of the affective properties of an environment is essential.},

abstract = {It has been speculated that computer game play by young people has negative correlates or consequences, although little evidence has emerged to support these fears. An alternative possibility is that <strong>game play may be associated with positive features of development</strong>, as the games reflect and contribute to participation in a challenging and stimulating voluntary leisure environment. This study examined the relationship between game play and several measures of adjustment or risk taking in a sample of 16-year-old high school students. No evidence was obtained of negative outcomes among game players. On <strong>several measures-including family closeness, activity involvement, positive school engagement, positive mental health, substance use, self-concept, friendship network, and disobedience to parents-game players scored more favorably than did peers who never played computer games</strong>. It is concluded that computer games can be a positive feature of a healthy adolescence.

Although the new technology has produced greater hardware reliability and maintainability, the corresponding potential benefits for operability have not always been achieved. Automation has introduced new forms of design and operating errors. One of the major reasons for this problem has been the lack of human factors advice and user participation early in the design process. This paper discusses a user-centred design approach to increase operability and user acceptance of new technologies and working practices. Application of this approach in the context of a chemical plant indicates its promise, but also highlights the difficulties involved in gaining user participation and management commitment. },

abstract = {Game designers attempt to ignite affective, emotional responses from players via engineering game designs to incite definite user experiences. Theories of emotion state that definite emotional responses are individual, and caused by the individual interaction sequence or history. Engendering desired emotions in the audience of traditional audiovisual media is a considerable challenge; however it is potentially even more difficult to achieve the same goal for the audience of interactive entertainment, because a substantial degree of control rests in the hand of the end user rather than the designer. This paper presents a possible solution to the challenge of integrating the user in the design of interactive entertainment such as computer games by employing the "persona" framework introduced by Alan Cooper. This approach is already in use in interaction design. The method can be improved by complementing the traditional narrative description of personas with quantitative, data-oriented models of predicted patterns of user behaviour for a specific computer game Additionally, persona constructs can be applied both as design-oriented metaphors during the development of games, and as analytical lenses to existing games, e.g. for evaluation of patterns of player behaviour.},

abstract = {Three tests from the computerized Neurobehavioral Examination System (NES) were administered to a group of 917 Faroese children at approximately 7 years of age. The NES Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was modified to use animal silhouettes as stimuli instead of letters. Almost all children completed Finger Tapping (FT), the modified CPT, and Hand-Eye Coordination (HE). However, 18\% of the children missed at least 25\% of the stimuli on the CPT (full test period)? and 37\% of the children did not improve their HE performance by at least 10\%, as compared to the first trial. Boys obtained better results than girls, and older children performed better than younger ones. However, both factors were confounded by acquaintance with computer games. Children who used glasses, who had strabismus, or who had decreased contrast sensitivity obtained less satisfactory scores, especially on CPT and HE. The NES performance was significantly associated with functional neurological performance, including catching a ball, diadochokinesia, and finger agnosia. Slight, though statistically significant, decrements were seen with increased levels of prenatal exposure to neurotoxicants, as indicated by the mercury concentrations in cord blood obtained at the time of birth. In conclusion, the tests were feasible in this age group after slight modifications, and the test results showed meaningful associations with major predictors, thus supporting the validity of the data.},

Personality and emotion-driven Believable Agents are needed in areas like human-machine interfaces, electronic advertising and, most notably, electronic entertainment. Computer models of personality can help explain personality by illustrating its underlying structure and dynamics. This work presents a neural network model of personality and personality change. The goals are to help understand personality and create more realistic and believable characters for interactive video games. The model is based largely on trait theories of personality. Behaviour in the model results from the interaction of three components: (1) personality-based predispositions for behaviour, (2) moods/emotions and (3) environmental situations. Personality develops gradually over time depending on the situations encountered. Modelling personality change produces interesting and believable virtual characters whose behaviours change in psychologically plausible ways.},

abstract = {Two epidemiologic studies have reported increased risk of childhood leukemia associated with the length of time children watched television (TV) programs or played video games connected to TV sets. To evaluate magnetic field exposures resulting from these activities, the static, ELF, and VLF magnetic fields produced by 72 TV sets used by children to watch TV programs and 34 TV sets used to play video games were characterized in a field study conducted in Washington DC and its Maryland suburbs. The resulting TV-specific magnetic field data were combined with information collected through questionnaires to estimate the magnetic field exposure levels associated with TV watching and video game playing. The geometric means of the ELF and VLF exposure levels so calculated were 0.0091 and 0.0016 mu T, respectively, for children watching TV programs and 0.023 and 0.0038 mu T, respectively, for children playing video games. Geometric means of ambient ELF and VLF levels with TV sets turned off were 0.10 and 0.0027 mu T, respectively. Summed over the ELF frequency range (6-3066 Hz), the exposure levels were small compared to ambient levels. However, in restricted ELF frequency ranges (120 Hz and 606-3066 Hz) and in the VLF band, TV exposure levels were comparable to or larger than normal ambient levels. Even so, the strengths of the 120 Hz or 606-3066 Hz components of TV fields were small relative to the overall ambient levels. Consequently, our results provide little support for a linkage between childhood leukemia and exposure to the ELF magnetic fields produced by TV sets. Our results do suggest that any future research on possible health effects of magnetic fields from television sets might focus on the VLF electric and magnetic fields produced by TV sets because of their enhanced ability relative to ELF fields to induce electric currents.},

To address this issue, a large dataset (N = 2,465) on grouping behavior was collected from an online game. Structural equation modeling was utilized to examine how group size and group competence diversity influences the group interaction process and group performance. The results suggest that group size has both direct and indirect effects on performance outcomes. Specific path analysis also shows that group size has a positive influence on the aggregation of group expertise, which has a positive effect on group performance. Group competence diversity and group size both have a negative effect on the frequency of group IM-based chat, which is in turn negatively related to group success in the online game environment. Theoretical and methodological implications of the findings for communication and small group research are discussed.},

abstract = {We propose a real-time 3D audio rendering pipeline for complex virtual scenes containing hundreds of moving sound sources. The approach, based on auditory culling and spatial level-of-detail, can handle more than ten times the number of sources commonly available on consumer 3D audio hardware, with minimal decrease in audio quality. The method performs well for both indoor and outdoor environments. It leverages the limited capabilities of audio hardware for many applications, including interactive architectural acoustics simulations and automatic 3D voice management for video games. Our approach dynamically eliminates inaudible sources and groups the remaining audible sources into a budget number of clusters. Each cluster is represented by one impostor sound source, positioned using perceptual criteria. Spatial audio processing is then performed only on the impostor sound sources rather than on every original source thus greatly reducing the computational cost. A pilot validation study shows that degradation in audio quality, as well as localization impairment, are limited and do not seem to vary significantly with the cluster budget. We conclude that our real-time perceptual audio rendering pipeline can generate spatialized audio for complex auditory environments without introducing disturbing changes in the resulting perceived soundfield.},

abstract = {As AI techniques become more widespread in computer games, and the area of synthetic characters matures, avatars in such computer games also tend to gain autonomy and become more clever. However, this autonomy may bring also some change in the interaction between users and game characters. Players may become less in charge of their characters and lose the power of complete motion or behavior control. On the other hand, characters may become more clever exhibiting much more interesting autonomous actions and behaviors. This paper presents, defines and discusses the concept of "influence", as an alternative to "direct" control of game characters, describing how influence can be achieved in computer games. To illustrate the notion of "influence" we will present a game called FantasyA where players interact with it by influencing the emotions of they semi-autonomous avatars using a tangible interface called SenToy. We show how "influence" was built into this game, the role of SenToy as an influencing device, and the reactions of the users to this type of control.},

To date, few studies examine electronic game play in Thai adolescents. Our research describes the prevalence of electronic game play and examines associations between the time spent engaged in electronic game play and school performance of adolescents in Hat-Yai municipality. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,492 adolescents from four secondary schools and one commercial college from January through March 2007, using questionnaires for collecting information about demographic data, school grades, and electronic game play behaviors. The prevalence of electronic game play was 75\% in boys and 59\% in girls. Twenty-two percent of boys and 8.7\% of girls played electronic games every day with more than 2 hours per session. The two most common places of game play were at game shops (71\%), followed by at their own home (70\%). Using linear regression analysis, the "low user or less than 2 hours per session" game players and females were less likely to have school grades below 3.00 with adjusted odds ratios of 0.44 (95\% CI 0.25-0.80, p = 0.004) and 0.49 (95\% CI 0.30-0.76, p = 0.005) respectively.

In both cases, responses were faster when the pictured object’s shape matched the shape implied by the sentence than when there was a mismatch.

abstract = {This article should serve as an introduction to a relatively new topic in ethnological studies requiring very specific methods as it involves both offline and online research as well as material objects and immaterial practices. How do we embark on an interdisciplinary venture such as this, and be sure to produce qualitative research of high standard? How should gaming mothers best be studied?
In what follows we try to answer that question. We also assume that not all of our readers are extensively familiar with games and game culture or have engaged with computer games first-hand or as scientific object of study. We thus begin with a short assessment of its current status as a growing genre, whose image is changing as gamers and game culture become increasingly diversified. We also briefly situate games as an academic subject and outline some of the central concepts focused in the fieldii called Game Studies. Furthermore, understanding the ideological underpinnings of play is vital to understanding the contexts in which games and gaming exist because they constitute some of the fundamental conditions of games research. To explain this, we relate the ambiguous status of game/play to the usage of the term --the magic circle\{$\backslash$textbardbl\} and of historically ingrained rhetorics [sic] of play.
In our survey of the theoretical land, we notice an increasing attention among games researchers to players in addition to the games themselves. We thus assert that ethnologists have a particular methodological edge and a role to fulfill as games research more and more means studying games in relation to gamers, society and political economy and not only the game itself. As part of a huge industry that is a significant economic driver, games take center stage on a global sociocultural and capital market. Educational programs and cross-disciplinary efforts centered on games and gaming grow steadily. Introducing our research project --Gaming Moms\{$\backslash$textbardbl\} we explain why it is interesting \{$\backslash$textendash\} and now possible and highly apposite \{$\backslash$textendash\} to study gaming from the perspective of culture, the family and the everyday. We give our rendition of how to best study a particular category of players such as mothers and why a marriage between ethnology and the interdisciplinary field of Game Studies is necessary and useful. In doing so, we give specific examples from our ongoing project thus presenting a selection of the various methods we apply in our research. Our examples are chosen around two themes \{$\backslash$textendash\} gaming and time management and representations of mothers in the context of gaming. We conclude with a brief discussion of our findings, having thus proposed an answer to our methodological question, and outline some missing perspectives and future challenges.},

However, type-1 diabetic children have not appreciated traditional learning methods since they rarely contain the elements of fun and interactivity. In this study, we developed, implemented and evaluated a preliminary version of edutainment tools for initial education for type-1 diabetic children. METHODS: Three games running on either personal computer (PC) and GameBoy Advance were developed. All games were designed to educate patients about relationships among food (carbohydrate), plasma glucose level, exercise, and insulin dose. A total of 58 testers evaluated degree of entertainment, usability and clinical usefulness of the games. RESULTS: Generally, testers felt all games were intuitive and fun and the usability of games was highly scored. More than 90\% of testers showed an interest in the edutainment approach, and approximately 60\% agreed that these games could provide attractive educational environment compared to traditional education, especially for children. CONCLUSIONS: Our edutainment systems were accepted as attractive learning tools for type-1 diabetic children who need initial education.

abstract = {The real-time interactive 3D multimedia applications such as 3D computer games and virtual reality (VR) have become prominent multimedia applications in recent years. In these applications, both visual fidelity and degree of interactivity are usually crucial to the success or failure of employment. Although the visual fidelity can be increased using more polygons for representing an object, it takes a higher rendering cost and adversely affects the rendering efficiency. To balance between the visual quality and the rendering efficiency, a set of level-of-detail (LOD) meshes has to be generated in advance. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient polygonal mesh simplification algorithm that is capable of generating a set of high-quality discrete LOD meshes in linear run time. The new algorithm adopts memoryless vertex quadric computation, and suggests the use of constant size replacement selection min-heap, pipelined simplification, two-stage optimization, and a new hole-filling scheme, which enable it to generate very high-quality LOD meshes using relatively small amount of main memory space in linear runtime.},

A temporal frame is a set of events, along with the temporality induced by the relationships between those events. The authors discuss four common temporal frames: real-world time (events taking place in the physical world), gameworld time (events within the represented gameworld, including events associated with gameplay actions), coordination time (events that coordinate the actions of players and agents), and fictive time (applying sociocultural labels to events, as well as narrated event sequences). They use frames to analyze the real-time/turn-based distinction, various temporal anomalies, and temporal manipulations as a form of gameplay. These discussions illustrate how temporal frames are useful for gaining a more nuanced understanding of temporal phenomena in games. Additionally, their relationist characterization of temporal frames supports analysis and design.},

This essay expresses an opinion on H. Volper\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s (2004) demand of condemning certain contents by media ethics. At the same time, an overview on the spread and use of "violent games" by children and youths is offered. As a matter of fact, the share of these titles in the complete range must not be estimated too high, certain titles on the other hand are extremely wide-spread. Finally, Fritz\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s and Fehr\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s thesis of the cultural conflict "computer game" (2004) is discussed, demonstrated at the example of the discussion on the internet, and on the basis of this thesis a mediating position between the two cultures including audience ethics (Funiok 1999) is presented.},

Confirmatory factor analysis using a structural equations approach was used to develop 3 scales. The scales were found to demonstrate satisfactory psychometric properties. The reliability coefficients for these scales were as follows: .85 for computer self-efficacy, .88 for work-related outcome expectancy; and .89 for personal outcome expectancy. The scales provide a strong foundation from which to refine the measurement of computer self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. From these refinements, empirical models that include self-efficacy and outcome expectancy as determinants of information technology acceptance at the individual level of analysis can be improved.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence for digital games constitutes the implementation of a set of algorithms and techniques from both traditional and modern artificial intelligence in order to provide solutions to a range of game dependent problems. However, the majority of current approaches lead to predefined, static and predictable game agent responses, with no ability to adjust during game-play to the behaviour or playing style of the player. Machine learning techniques provide a way to improve the behavioural dynamics of computer controlled game agents by facilitating the automated generation and selection of behaviours, thus enhancing the capabilities of digital game artificial intelligence and providing the opportunity to create more engaging and entertaining game-play experiences. This paper provides a survey of the current state of academic machine learning research for digital game environments, with respect to the use of techniques from neural networks, evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning for game agent control.},

Before playing a game, second- and fifth-graders were instructed to adopt an evaluative, process, outcome, or no specific goal focus while playing. Children were then asked about the game strategies and game features they attended to while playing. Older children showed better performance overall and their best performance when instructed to adopt an evaluative goal. Younger children showed their worst performance in the same condition. This developmental pattern of findings was reversed among children instructed to adopt an outcome goal. Postgame responses indicated developmental differences in game features, strategies, and evaluation assessments. Most children across both grades made reference to process goals. These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that gifted children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s goals for learning impact their performance and attention and that this impact may be influenced by their developmental level.},

Games, like Assassin\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Creed (Ubisoft, released 2007), The Sims (Maxis, released 2000), Guitar Hero (RedOctane, released 2005), and World of War Craft (Bilizzard, released 2004), have attracted many players from different cultures and age groups. In this paper, we propose that the experience of playing a video game, like Assassin\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Creed, is a personal experience shaped through one\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s emotional values, expectations, knowledge, and attitudes as influenced by culture. To validate this claim, we provide an analysis of the experience of playing Assassins\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} Creed from the perspectives of this paper\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s four co-authors, who represent two different cultural viewpoints: Middle-Eastern and Western, as well as different intellectual disciplinary backgrounds, including architecture, theatre, and computer science. To someone from the Middle-East, for example, the game aroused many nostalgic feelings through its simulated Middle-Eastern cities, the use of Arabic words, accents and gestures, and the detailed Middle-Eastern architectural design. While such small details meant much when viewed through a Middle-Eastern eye, their values were different when viewed through a Western eye. From a Western perspective, the game play experience was heightened through the beautiful architectural detail and the use of the environment layout as a function of gameplay, such as the use of rooftops for platforming, fast movement and flying-like actions, and stealth. Thus, apparently the way the game was experienced was very different when viewed through people with different cultural backgrounds. In this paper, we aim to show this claim through thorough analysis of the game as experienced by the co\{$\backslash$textlnot\}authors.},

This report discusses some issues concerning serious games, that is, (digital) games used for purposes other than mere entertainment. The starting point is the serious games concept itself, and what the actually means. Further, serious games allow learners to experience situations that are impossible in the real world for reasons of safety, cost, time, etc., but they are also claimed to have positive impacts on the players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} development of a number of different skills. Subsequently, some possible positive (and negative) impacts of serious games are discussed. Further, some of the markets such games are used in are considered here, including, military games, government games, educational games, corporate games, and healthcare games. This report also identifies some (mainly academic) actors in the North American and the European serious games market. This report is part of the DISTRICT (Developing Industrial Strategies Through Innovative Cluster and Technologies) project: Serious Games Cluster and Business Network (SER3VG), which is part of the Interreg IIIC Programme.

We built into the RPG-PLA a number of performance optimization strategies that could benefit any of the four (and possibly other similar) RPGs. By comparing the original vs. the new RPGs derived from the RPG-PLA, we demonstrated that reuse allowed us to achieve improved performance, both speed and memory utilization, as compared to each game developed individually. At the same time, our solution facilitated rapid development of new games, for new mobile devices, as well as ease of evolving with new features the RPG-PLA and custom games already in use.},

A very important aspect of computer games is the artificial intelligence (AI) of non-player characters. To create interesting AI in games today, developers or players have to create complex, dynamic behavior for a very small number of characters, but neither the game engines nor the style of AI programming enables intelligent behavior that scales to a very large number of non-player characters. In this paper we make a first step towards truly scalable AI in computer games by modeling game AI as a data management problem. We present a highly expressive scripting language SGL that provides game designers and players with a data-driven AI scheme for customizing behavior for individual non-player characters. We use sophisticated query processing and indexing techniques to efficiently execute large numbers of SGL scripts, thus providing a framework for games with a truly epic number of non-player characters. Experiments show the efficacy of our solutions.},

It draws on a large-scale data set of video recordings of the everyday lives of middleclass families. The recordings of gaining between children and between children and parents show that response cries were not arbitrarily located within different phases of gaining (planning, gaming or commenting on gaining). Response cries were primarily used as interactional resources for securing and sustaining joint attention (cf. Goodwin, 1996) during the gaming as such, that is, during periods when the gaming activity was characterized by a relatively high tempo. In gaining between children, response cries co-occurred with their animations of game characters and with sound making, singing along, and code switching in ways that formed something of an action aesthetic, a type of aesthetic that was most clearly seen in gaining between game equals (here: between children). In contrast, response cries were rare during the planning phases and during phases in which the participants primarily engaged in setting up or adjusting the game.},

abstract = {Objectives: To quantify the depiction of violence, blood, sexual themes, profanity, substances, and gambling in video games rated M (for "mature") and to measure agreement between the content observed and the rating information provided to consumers on the game box by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Design: We created a database of M-rated video game titles, selected a random sample, recorded at least 1 hour of game play, quantitatively assessed the content, performed statistical analyses to describe the content, and compared our observations with the Entertainment Software Rating Board content descriptors and results of our prior studies. Setting: Harvard University, Boston, Mass. Participants: Authors and 1 hired game player. Main Exposure: M-rated video games. Main Outcome Measures: Percentages of game play depicting violence, blood, sexual themes, gambling, alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs; use of profanity in dialogue, song lyrics, or gestures. Results: Although the Entertainment Software Rating Board content descriptors for violence and blood provide a good indication of such content in the game, we identified 45 observations of content that could warrant a content descriptor in 29 games (81\%) that lacked these content descriptors. M-rated video games are significantly more likely to contain blood, profanity, and substances; depict more severe injuries to human and non-human characters; and have a higher rate of human deaths than video games rated T (for "teen"). Conclusion: Parents and physicians should recognize that popular M-rated video games contain a wide range of unlabeled content and may expose children and adolescents to messages that may negatively influence their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.},

Our premise is that whereas the hermeneutic method is academically well-established, its conscious application is not. It is suggested that with conscious application of the hermeneutic method the persistent and problematic questions in game studies, like those related to narrative, definition, and art, gain potential to be treated with increased sophistication.},

abstract = {Continuing medical education has historically been provided primarily by didactic lectures, though adult learners prefer experiential or self-directed learning. Young physicians have extensive experience with computer-based or "video" games, priming them for medical education-and treating their patients-via new technologies. We report our use of standardized patients (SPs) to educate physicians on the diagnosis and treatment of biological and chemical warfare agent exposure. We trained professional actors to serve as SPs representing exposure to biological agents such as anthrax and smallpox. We rotated workshop participants through teaching stations to interview, examine, diagnose and treat SPs. We also trained SPs to simulate a chemical mass casualty (MASCAL) incident. Workshop participants worked together to treat MASCAL victims, followed by discussion of key teaching points. More recently, we developed computer-based simulation (CBS) modules of patients exposed to biological agents. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of CBS vs. live SPs. Finally, we detail plans for a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy compared to pharmacotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with significant disability and healthcare costs, which may be ameliorated by the identification of more effective therapy.},

We analyze anthropometric data on Maya children in Guatemala and in the United States. In addition, we use survey data from the Maya-American children and their parents about lifestyle and SES to examine the factors associated with overweight and obesity. Results. The Maya-American children are on average 10 centimeters taller, indicating better health. However, nearly half the Maya-American children are overweight and 42 percent are obese. Children who report watching TV or playing computer games as one of their favorite leisure time activities face a higher chance of being overweight. Conclusion. Immigration from Guatemala to the United States improves the health of children in that they generally grow taller. However, immigration also raises the risk of weight problems, increasing the likelihood of health problems such as hypertension and diabetes.},

The seizures may be clinically generalized, but unilateral and bilateral myoclonic attacks also may be triggered, especially in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and recently, clearly focal reflex occipital lobe seizures have been described. Some seizure-triggering properties of video displays can be identified, such as perceived brightness, pattern, flicker frequency, and color. Knowledge of these is useful in planning individual treatment and in designing regulations for screen content of television broadcasts or for other video displays. Some subjects will also be sensitive to cognitive or action-programming activation, especially when playing video games, and this can increase the chance of seizure triggering. Nonspecific factors such as sleep deprivation, prolonged exposure, and drug or alcohol use also may play a role in reflex seizure occurrence.},

abstract = {The concept of narrative has been widely invoked by theorists of digital textuality, but the promotion ofwhat is described as the storytelling power of the computer has often relied on shallow metaphors, loose conceptions of narrative, and literary models that ignore the distinctive properties of the digital medium.Twomyths have dominated this theorization.The myth of the Aleph (as I call it) presents the digital text as a finite text that contains an infinite number of stories.Themyth of the Holodeck envisions digital narrative as a virtual environment in which the user becomes a character in a plot similar to those of Victorian novels or Shakespearean tragedies. Both of thesemyths rely on questionable assumptions: that any permutation of a collection of lexias results in a coherent story; that it is aesthetically desirable to be the hero of a story; and that digital narrativity should cover the same range of emotional experiences as literary narrative. Here I argue that digital narrative should emancipate itself from literary models. But I also view narrative as a universal structure that transcends media.This article addresses the question of reconciling the inherent linearity of narrative structures with themultiple paths made possible by the interactive nature of the digital text by distinguishing four forms of interactivity, which result from the cross-classification of two binaries: internal versus external interactivity; and exploratory versus ontological. Each of these categories is shown to favor different narrative themes and different variations of the universal narrative structure.},

Intervention: A COP-controlled, video game-based exercise system. Main Outcome Measures: The following were calculated during 12 different tasks: the number of falls, range of COP excursion, and COP path length. Results: Postexercise, subjects exhibited a lower fall count, decreased COP excursion limits for some tasks, increased practice volume, and increased attention span during training. Conclusions: The COP-controlled video game-based exercise regime motivated subjects to increase their practice volume and attention span during training.

abstract = {Whilst no consensus yet exists on how the Internet of Things will be realised, a global infrastructure of networked physical objects that are readable, recognizable, locatable, addressable and controllable is undoubtedly a compelling vision. Although many implementations of the Internet of Things have presented these objects in a largely ambient sensing role, or providing some form of remote access/ control, in this paper we consider the emerging convergence between games and the Internet of Things. This can be seen in a growing number of games that use objects as physical game pieces to enhance the players’ interaction with virtual games. These hybrid physical/ digital objects present game designers with number of interesting challenges as they i) blur the boundaries between toys and games; ii) provide opportunities for freeform physical play outside the virtual game; and iii) create new requirements for interaction design, in that they utilise design techniques from both product design and computer interface design. Whilst in the past the manufacturing costs of such game objects would preclude their use within games from small independent games developers, the advent of low cost 3D printing and open software and hardware platforms, which are the enablers of the Internet of Things, means this is no longer the case. However, in order to maximise this opportunity game designers will need to develop new approaches to the design of their games and in this paper we highlight the design sensibilities required if they are to combine the digital and physical affordances within the design of such objects to produce good player experiences.},

abstract = {We propose a new algorithm for distributed power control in cellular communication systems. We define a cost for each mobile that consists of a weighted sum of power and square of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) error and obtain the static Nash equilibrium for the resulting costs. The algorithm requires only interference power measurements and/or SIR measurements from the base station and converges even in cases where limits on available power render the target SIRs unattainable. Examples generated using realistic data demonstrate that, in demanding environments, the Nash equilibrium power provides substantial power savings as compared to the power balancing algorithm while reducing the achieved SIR only slightly. Additional simulations show that the benefit of the Nash equilibrium power control over the power balancing solution increases as the receiver noise power or number of users in the cell increases. The algorithm has the advantage that it can be implemented distributively. An additional benefit of the algorithm is that, based on their chosen cost function, mobiles may choose to "opt out" i.e., stop transmitting, if they determine that the power required to achieve their SIR objectives is more expensive to them than not transmitting at all.},

abstract = {This paper sets out a position for development-led research as a specific form of study into games. It is argued that cataloguing elements of representative samples of games is the only real solution to building solid foundations of knowledge from which to understand patterns across the medium, within which to base specific analysis or theorising. The creation of this baseline data leads to questions about game design, particularly, which cannot be addressed by analysing existing titles. Developing experimental games and releasing these into the market place is put forwards as the only viable means of doing so. One such title is introduced and discussed, and the response from the gaming community is summarised to support this argument.},

Both video games and video clips have been neglected and marginalized by the academy, albeit to varying degrees. Given their pervasiveness, especially among Middle Eastern youth, we are in crucial need today of critical understanding of the different ways these media articulate Islam and communicate it to consumers. This chapter in particular discusses the appropriation of games by various private Islamic companies, operating in the broader religious and cultural context of the Islamic revival and piety movement, for educational purposes. Finally, this chapter discusses how Islamic game production and, more generally, the public discourse of the Islamic piety movement are shaping mainstream video game production targeted at Muslim audiences and the marketing strategies of game production companies.},

abstract = {This study examines how trust is related to online social institutions, self-disclosure, mode of communication, and message privacy in a popular MMOG, Everquest II. The findings, based on survey and behavioral data from over 3,500 players, illustrate how MMOGs may support trust-development. Trust was higher within closer social circles: trust was highest in teammates, followed other players across the game, followed by others online. Self-disclosure was positively related to trust of teammates and others in the game, while voice chat was only related to teammate trust. These findings indicate that social structures and communication processes contribute to trust development in MMOGs, supporting the claim that these online spaces provide social support that is unavailable in other realms of our society.},

Klabbers, KMPC, The Netherlands The purpose of this unique book is to present principles underlying the design and use of gaming and simulation. This frame-of-reference will enlighten the characteristics of particular games and simulations from a common perspective. The author pays less attention to instrumental reasoning than to methodological questions bexause there is no robust methodology that underpins gaming and simulation methods. Gaming and simulation are more than methods and tools. They are firstly a way of thinking, and secondly, a method and a technique. In addition, the framework presented will help to grasp the interplay between forms of knowledge and knowledge content in connection with gaming, which evolves through the action of the players. These notions are considered preconditions for raising epistemological questions in relation to the educational value of games and simulations. They will provide a proper context for addressing design science and analytical science approaches to artifact assessment and theory development and testing. Due to the high diversity of approaches within the field the author chooses an interdisciplinary and where appropriate meta-disciplinary approach.

The effects of outcome, sex, trait aggressiveness and current mood on subsequent subject-generated material were also examined. Fifty subjects read stories line by line on a computer screen. Reading time for the key sentence describing a positive or negative outcome to an aggressive reaction to provocation was recorded and subjects wrote a continuing sentence to half the stories. Subjects took less time to process the negative outcome. The positive outcome resulted in more subject-generated aggression than the negative outcome. There were few sex differences but men wrote more aggressive endings than women for the stories containing physical aggression. Trait aggressiveness was correlated with producing more aggressive content in the continuing sentence for both outcomes. Feeling peaceful was correlated with producing prosocial material to neutral stories. Subjects therefore expect a negative outcome to aggressive behaviour. Reading stories which present a positive outcome to aggression increases the accessibility of aggressive cognitions. Subjects high in trait aggressiveness are not inhibited by a negative outcome. },

abstract = {Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) are computer based games in which players interact with one another in the virtual world. Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs have seen amazing growth in last few years and it is more than a 2 billion dollars industry as per current estimates. Huge amount of revenue potential has attracted several gaming companies to launch online role playing games. One of the major problems these companies suffer apart from fierce competition is erosion of their customer base. Churn is a big problem for the gaming companies as churners impact negatively in the word-of-mouth reports for potential and existing customers leading to further erosion of user base.

We study the problem of player churn in the popular MMORPG EverQuest II. The problem of churn prediction has been studied extensively in the past in various domains and social network analysis has recently been applied to the problem to understand the effects of the strength of social ties and the structure and dynamics of a social network in churn. In this paper, we propose a churn prediction model based on examining social influence among players and their personal engagement in the game. We hypothesize that social influence is a vector quantity, with components negative influence and positive influence. We propose a modified diffusion model to propagate the influence vector in the players network which represents the social influence on the player from his network. We measure a players personal engagement based on his activity patterns and use it in the modified diffusion model and churn prediction. Our method for churn prediction which combines social influence and player engagement factors has shown to improve prediction accuracy significantly for our dataset as compared to prediction using the conventional diffusion model or the player engagement factor, thus validating our hypothesis that combination of both these factors could lead to a more accurate churn prediction.},

abstract = {This article solves two puzzles in copyright law. First, it has long been blackletter law that games are not copyrightable. But the origins of this rule are lost to history, and the reasons for it are not obvious. Second, it has never been adequately explained what makes something a "system\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}" excluded from copyright protection under Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act. Modern courts interpret "system" as merely a synonym for "idea" or "process", two other categories of exclusions. Others have interpreted it using the broadest definition in the dictionary, which would sweep in large amounts of copyrightable material as well. Neither definition gives the term any meaningful content. Like solving a crossword puzzle, this Article uses each of these questions to shed light on the other. Games are uncopyrightable because they are systems. The case law that led to the adoption of Section 102(b) demonstrates that systems are schemes for transforming user inputs into a correlated set of outputs. Games do exactly that. A game is a scheme for transforming player activities into moves within the game. The reason why games and other systems are uncopyrightable then becomes clear: the purpose of a system is to serve as a forum for user activity; it is users, not authors, who provide the primary informational value to the outputs of a system. Games and other systems are excluded in order to fence in copyright protection before it reaches user creation.},

METHOD: Twenty-two eligible children completed a pretest to determine knowledge and confidence levels, played the Sickle Cell Slime-O-Rama Game, then completed an identical posttest. FINDINGS: Significant increases in knowledge (t = 2.828, p =.010) and confidence (t = 3.759, p =.001) levels between pre- and posttests were identified. CONCLUSIONS: It is promising that a simple, interacting CD-ROM game allowed children with sickle cell disease to quickly acquire knowledge about the disease and symptom management, and increased their confidence to apply this new knowledge. Results suggest the high utility of this tailored game to foster active self-management behaviors in this population.},

abstract = {Gender-inclusivity in games has been a much debated issue and despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. Gender-inclusivity in games may support certain features and in turn may even determine the features of applications built based on it. This poses a challenge: although we have good techniques for analyzing, designing and evaluating current games, our techniques for gender-inclusive games are much less formed. We present a brief outline of some unresolved issues concerning gender-inclusivity in games and the gaps in designing a more gender-inclusive game. There is little reported experience in the issues that arise in determining what features should go into a gender-inclusive game and for determining the success or failure in the evaluation of those features. The questions that arise from this situation are how to define gender-inclusivity in games, how to incorporate gender-inclusivity into a game creation process and how to accurately measure gender-inclusivity in games. We propose a framework that defines gender-inclusivity in three key themes: 
(1) gameplay, describing the game behaviour and how a player experiences the game. It include non-violent action (NVA), game support (GS), forgiving gameplay (FG), non-violent challenge (NVC), feedback system (FS), variety of activities (ACT), personalization (PER) and collaboration (COLL);
(2) content, describing the aesthetics elements of a game. It consists of character/avatar portrayal (AVP), game world graphics (GW), sound/music (SM) and storyline (STOR) and;
(3) genre, categorizes games into twelve broad genres: racing, simulation, classic/board, strategy, sports, shooting, role playing game, platform, children, puzzle/quiz, action and adventure. 
On-going research is being planned for experiments to validate the framework through expert reviews, game evaluations and game design projects. We believe the results may extend to other domains in technology enhanced teaching and learning applications to commercial games design.},

To better understand the triggering elements of visual stimuli and cortical mechanisms of hyperexcitability, we examined eleven patients with idiopathic photosensitive epilepsy by recording visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to temporally modulated patterns of different contrast. For stimuli of low-medium, but not high, temporal frequency, the contrast dependence of VEP amplitude and latency is remarkably abnormal for luminance contrast (black-white), but not so for chromatic contrast (equiluminant red-green) stimuli. We conclude that cortical mechanisms of contrast gain control for pattern stimuli of relatively low temporal frequency and high luminance contrast are lacking or severely impaired in photosensitive subjects.},

The system was developed between imedia in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, and Questacon: The National Science and Technology Centre in Canberra, Australia. Communicating and implementing the project over such a distance was not problematic given the clearly defined roles of each team. The part of the project that required extensive negotiation and redesign was how the user interacts with each activity.

Similar to Internet addiction, the pathological use of MMORPG is a kind of modern addiction that can affect students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} lives on both a physical and a psychological level. The purpose of this study is to understand MMORPG addiction from a user experience design approach. We first developed a complete model that includes eleven factors (challenge, fantasy, curiosity, control, reward, cooperation, competition, recognition, belonging, obligation and role-playing) to represent users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} experience in MMORPGs. After that, we design a questionnaire to measure student\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} gaming experience and level of addiction. Students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} demography information, including gender and game playing habits, was also collected. Four hundred and eighteen Taiwanese college students aged 18-25 years old took part in this online survey. Regression analysis was then conducted to evaluate the relative explanatory power of each variable, with addiction score as the dependent variable and the eleven user experience factors as the independent variables. The results of regression analysis reveal five critical factors (curiosity, role-playing, belonging, obligation and reward) that can be used to predict MMORPG addiction. In addition, this study also infers possible casual mechanisms for increasing college students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} level of addiction. The implications of our findings for both design and educational practitioners were also discussed.},

tied to mother/calf behavior) and from interviews with marine mammal scientists and education staff at the Vancouver Aquarium. The collaborative user interface allows visitors to engage in educational "what-if" scenarios of wild beluga emergent behavior using techniques from advanced gaming systems, such as physically based animation, real-time photo-realistic rendering, and artificial intelligence algorithms.},

We find that TCP experiences low throughput as a result of the well- known problem of ACK compression. An algorithm that controls ACK spacing is introduced to improve TCP performance.},

abstract = {Avatars in online games and worlds are seen as players' key representations in interactions with each other. In this article, we investigate the avatar design and identity play within a large-scale tween virtual world called Whyville.net, with more than 1.5 million registered players of ages 8--16. One unique feature of Whyville is the players' ability to customize their avatars with various face parts and accessories, all designed and sold by other players in Whyville. Our findings report on the expressive resources available for avatar construction, individual tween players' choices and rationales in creating their avatars, and online postings about avatar design in the community at large. With the growing interest in player-generated content for online worlds such as Second Life, our discussion will address the role of avatars in identity play and self-representation as well as the social issues that arise within the game world.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying video-game epilepsy by comparing the flicker- and spatial-frequency ranges over which photic and pattern stimulation elicited photoparoxysmal responses in two different populations: (a) 25 patients with a history of seizures experienced while playing video games; and (b) 25 age- and medication-matched controls with a history of photosensitive epilepsy, but no history of video-game seizures. METHODS: Abnormality ranges were determined by measuring photoparoxysmal EEG abnormalities as a function of the flicker frequency of patterned and diffuse intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) and the spatial frequency of patterns on a raster display. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of the abnormality ranges elicited by patterned or diffuse IPS or by spatial patterns. When the groups were compared at one specific IPS frequency (-50 Hz), however, the flicker frequency of European television displays, the video-game patients were significantly more likely to be sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that video-game seizures are a manifestation of photosensitive epilepsy. The increased sensitivity of video-game patients to IPS at 50 Hz indicates that display flicker may underlie video-game seizures. The similarity in photic- and pattern-stimulation ranges over which abnormalities are elicited in video-game patients and controls suggests that all patients with photosensitive epilepsy may be predisposed toward video-game-induced seizures. Photosensitivity screening should therefore include assessment by using both IPS at 50 Hz and patterns displayed on a television or monitor with a 50-Hz frame rate.},

Globally, how do some regions or groups emerge as experts or leaders in play style? Analysis indicates that within the United States, Californian players from major cities dominate discussion, supported by the global flows of people, resources, and capital through the state. The dominant players support their stated norms for play through recourse to mainstream conceptions of masculinity, rap music and associated styles of dance.},

online games (MMOGs); however, by their nature, these games are difficult to investigate. Game play is
often complex and the underlying mechanisms are frequently opaque. In contrast, board games are simple.
Their game play is fairly constrained and their core mechanisms are transparent enough to analyze. In this
article, the authors seek to understand collaborative games. Because of their simplicity, they focus on board
games. The authors present an analysis of collaborative games. In particular, they focus on Reiner Knizia\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s

yields seven observations, four lessons, and three pitfalls, that game designers might consider useful for
designing collaborative games. They reflect on the particular opportunities that computers have for the

Interactive Narrative is an approach to interactive entertainment that enables the player to make decisions that directly affect the direction and/or outcome of the narrative experience being delivered by the computer system. Interactive narrative requires two seemingly conflicting requirements: coherent narrative and user agency. We present an interactive narrative system that uses a combination of narrative control and autonomous believable character agents to augment a story world simulation in which the user has a high degree of agency with narrative plot control. A drama manager called the Automated Story Director gives plot-based guidance to believable agents. The believable agents are endowed with the autonomy necessary to carry out directives in the most believable fashion possible. Agents also handle interaction with the user. When the user performs actions that change the world in such a way that the Automated Story Director can no longer drive the intended narrative forward, it is able to adapt the plot to incorporate the user\&\#39;s changes and still achieve dramatic goals.

This cyber-diffusion, however, has a cautionary side: while significantly enhancing the potential for disparate individuals and groups to collectively pool resources and strategy, the Internet also holds the power to turn unreliable and unverifiable information into a global electronic riot.},

This approach makes problem-based learning ideal for teaching lean manufacturing, which is driven by a culture of problem solving that values learning as one key output of manufacturing production. Thus, simulations that organize participants in teams for realistic manufacturing production problem solving are widespread as a way to use problem-based learning to teach lean manufacturing. But a critical assessment of existing simulations for lean manufacturing instruction has been lacking. Accordingly, a literature survey is conducted and existing simulations are classified according to their emphasis on lean tools or the overall lean system; the degree of their focus on soft skills, if any; and their area of application, whether academic or industry. Four gaps are found in existing simulation designs: lack of stress on soft skills, a mistaken focus on \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}linear lean,\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} misunderstanding of the key role of the facilitator, and lack of realism. Future directions for study and improvement in lean simulation design are suggested.},

In addition, se (expressiveness and subjective norms have been showed to significantly and directly affect perceived usefulness. It was also confirmed that self-efficacy and operational quality of device are the antecedents of perceived ease of use. The contents of mobile games as well as perceived enjoyment was used as a determinant of perceived ease of use, and the statistical results confirm that they played a critical role in determining perceptions of enjoyment, and indirectly affecting perceived usefulness.},

In spite of this, the programming of an artificial opponent is still a hard and time consuming task in the way it is done for the most games today. In this paper we propose a system in which no direct programming of the behaviour of the opponents is necessary. Instead, rules are gained by observing human players and then evaluated and optimised by an evolutionary algorithm to optimise the behaviour. We will show that only little learning effort is required to be competitive in reactive situations.

abstract = {Recently a new generation of virtual worlds has emerged in which users are provided with open-ended modelling tools with which they can create and modify world content. The result is evolving virtual spaces for commerce, education and social interaction. In general, these virtual worlds are not games and have no concept of winning, however the open-ended modelling capacity is nonetheless compelling. The rising popularity of open-ended virtual worlds suggests that there may also be potential for a new generation of computer games situated in open-ended environments. A key issue with the development of such games, however, is the design of non-player characters which can respond autonomously to unpredictable, open-ended changes to their environment. This paper considers the impact of open-ended modelling on character development in simulation games. Motivated reinforcement learning using context-free grammars is proposed as a means of representing unpredictable, evolving worlds for character reasoning. This technique is used to design adaptive characters for the Second Life virtual world to create a new kind of open-ended simulation game.

Existing work is limited by the use of correlational designs and is thus unable to make causal inferences or remove self-selection biases from observed results. The recent development of online, socially integrated video games (massively multiplayer online role-playing games [MMORPGs]) has created a new experience for gamers. This randomized, longitudinal study examined the effects of being assigned to play different video game types on game usage, health, well-being, sleep, socializing, and academics. One hundred 18- to 20-year-old participants (73\% male; 68\% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to play arcade, console, solo computer, or MMORPG games for 1 month. The MMORPG group differed significantly from other groups after 1 month, reporting more hours spent playing, worse health, worse sleep quality, and greater interference in "real-life" socializing and academic work. In contrast, this group also reported greater enjoyment in playing, greater interest in continuing to play, and greater acquisition of new friendships. MMORPGs represent a different gaming experience with different consequences than other types of video games and appear to pose both unique risks and benefits from their use.},

abstract = {The reusability of design processes modeled in existing Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) frameworks has been limited to the level of flow charts or activity-based diagrams that serve as planning and organizational aids. Current simulation-based design frameworks provide limited support for reuse of design processes at a level where design processes are networks of computational operations, specifically the capabilities to reuse (a) design processes for different products, and (b) collaborative design strategies. In this article, we address these limitations by providing a modeling approach for simulation-based design processes so that they can be archived in a generic modular fashion and reused for collaborative design of different products. The proposed approach is based on four foundations: (a) modeling design processes as hierarchical systems, (b) separation of declarative and procedural information, (c) modeling design processes as decision-centric activities, and (d) modeling interactions between decision makers using game theoretic protocols. These four fundamentals of the approach are instantiated in the form of generic computational templates for products, processes, decisions, and pertinent interfaces. The approach is illustrated using a proof of concept implementation in ModelCenter. The implementation is validated by showing the reusability of design processes for two different products, a spring and a pressure vessel, in individual and collaborative design scenarios. The approach has potential for supporting reusability of broader PLM processes.},

@article{Cutumisu2007,
abstract = {The traditional approach to implementing interactions between a player character (PC) and objects in computer games is to write scripts in a procedural scripting language. These scripts are usually so complex that they must be written by a computer programmer rather than by the author of the game story. This interruption in the game story authoring process has two distinct disadvantages: it increases the cost of game production and it introduces a disconnect between the author\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s intentions and the interactions produced from the programmer\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s written scripts. We introduce a mechanism to solve these problems. We show that game authors (non-programmers) can generate the necessary scripts for implementing meaningful interactions between the PC and game objects using a three-step process. In the first step, the author uses a generative pattern (concept) to create a high-level description of a commonly occurring game scenario. In the second step, the author uses a standard set of adaptation operations to customize the high-level description to the particular circumstances of the story that is being told. In the third step, the author presses a button that automatically generates scripting code from the adapted pattern. We describe the results of three studies in which a combined total of 56 game story authors used this three-step process to construct Neverwinter Nights game stories, using a tool called ScriptEase. We believe that this generative/adaptive process is the key to future game story scripting. More generally, this article advocates the development of adaptive programming as an alternative to current constructive programming techniques, as well as the application of adaptive programming in many domains.},

As a consequence, a computer player is needed who might take into account the danger or the chance of his actions. This work examines whether it is possible to train such a player by evolutionary algorithms. For the sake of controllable game situations, the board game Kalah is turned into an unsteady version and used to examine the problem.},

It is argued that due to the particular nature of digital games, both structural analysis and textual analysis are relevant to game studies. Unfortunately they tend to be conflated. Neither structural nor textual factors will fully determine meaning, but they are aspects of the cycle through which meaning is produced during play. Meaning in games is emergent, and play is a situated practice. Undertaking the textual analysis of a game does not necessarily involve ignoring these points. Textual analysis, like any methodology, does have limitations. The specifics of these limitations, however, will depend on the particular model of textuality employed. These issues are explored through an analysis of the horror survival game, Resident Evil 4.},

abstract = {Computer Graphics (CG) animations of natural phenomena are currently widely used for movies and in video games. Granular materials occur widely in nature, and therefore it is necessary that CG animations represent ground surfaces composed of a granular material as well as model deformations when the granular material comes into contact with other physical rigid objects (called solid objects). In this paper, we propose a deformation algorithm for ground surfaces composed of granular material. The deformation algorithm is divided into three steps: (1) detection of the collision between a solid object and the ground surface, (2) displacement of the granular material and (3) erosion of the material at steep slopes. The proposed algorithm can handle solid objects of various shapes, including concave polyhedra by additionally using a layered data structure called the Height Span Map. Furthermore, a texture sliding technique is presented to render the motion of granular materials. In addition, our implementation of the deformation algorithm can be used at interactive frame rates.},

Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) is one of the solutions, but in cases of severe aliasing it can only mask the aliasing by unnaturally blurring. In this paper we present two improved antialiased shadow algorithms based on PCF, named as Modified PCF I and Modified PCF II. The primary idea of our algorithms is to make sawtooth shadow edges straighter just by data modification before bilinear interpolation in PCF. We respectively implement the algorithms with graphic hardware in Pixel Shader 2.0 and 3.0, several examples are also provided to show that most of aliasing artifacts have been removed compared with PCF. The time complexity and hardware requirement of Modified PCF I are almost as same as that of PCF. The resource requirement of Modified PCF II is more rigorous than that of Modified PCF I, but it can still accommodate to real-time game rendering with obvious antialiasing effect.},

abstract = {Research studying the effects of playing videogames has largely focused on their negative effects on aggressive attitudes and behaviour. The potential positive effects have received less theoretical and empirical attention. The current study used flow theory to permit a wider examination of the potential consequences of gaming for measures of affect and psychological well-being. It also aimed to examine the relationship between aggressive personality, gaming experience and mood effects. An experimental design was used, in which frequent gamers (N = 56) were recruited to play one of two videogames. Pre-test measures of trait aggression, psychological well-being and affect were taken. Following a forty minute gameplay period, post-test measures on affect and flow were completed. Findings of the pre and post-test affect measures showed that gaming facilitated positive mood and activation. Also, flow in gameplay showed to have positive associations with dimensions psychological well-being. Aggression showed no relationship with flow or with post-test positive or negative affect which suggests that gaming experiences are not significantly influenced by aggressive personality. The findings revealed minimal differences in measures of post-test affect or flow between the two game conditions. This suggests that violent game content is not the most crucial factor in determining the nature of the gaming experience and its impact on outcomes. Rather, it implies the process of gaming to be more important for gamers. Future research should aim to address this issue by considering gaming as a holistic experience rather than focusing too strongly on outcomes of exposure to violent content.

User satisfaction was measured in 12 children with CP, using a postexperience questionnaire, primarily based on a presence questionnaire. In general, children with CP were satisfied with and motivated by the EyeToy training. In addition, a first evaluation study was performed to determine the effect of this training method on the upper limb function. Ten children with CP were randomly assigned to the intervention (mean age 11 years, 9 months; SD 2,3) and the control group (mean age 12 years, 3 months; SD 3,2). After a treatment period of 6 weeks, the intervention group completed a user satisfaction questionnaire. Functional outcome was measured using the Melbourne Assessment scores. Percentage scores of the Melbourne Assessment of 7 of the 10 children were the same or changed only 1\% to 2\% from baseline to followup. However, in the experimental group, two children improved more, 9\% and 13\% respectively. In conclusion, it can be said that the EyeToy is a motivational training tool for the training of children with CP and has the potential to improve upper extremity function. $\backslash$copyright2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose: To describe longitudinal changes in leisure-time sedentary behavior among girls, during early to mid-adolescence. Methods: A 2.5-year prospective cohort study, comprising 5 data collections, 6 months apart, between 2000 and 2002. Girls aged 12-15 years (n = 200) from 8 high schools located in Sydney, Australia, self-reported the usual time spent each week in a comprehensive range of sedentary behaviors. Results: Retention rate for the study was 82\%. Girls aged 12.8 years spent approximately 45\% of their discretionary time in sedentary behavior, which increased to 63\% at age 14.9 years. Watching TV, videos, and playing video games (small screen recreation; SSR) was the most popular sedentary pastime, accounting for 33\% of time spent in sedentariness, followed by homework and reading (25\%). Sedentary behavior increased 1.4 and 3.3 hours on week and weekend days, respectively. On weekdays, increased time was spent on hobbies (27 min/day) and on weekend days, increased time was spent sitting around talking with friends (60 min/day), computer use (37 min/day), and television viewing (34 min/day). Conclusions: Among girls, the transition between early and mid-adolescence was accompanied by a significant increase in leisure-time sedentary behavior. Interventions to reduce sedentariness among adolescent girls are best to focus on weekend behaviors. Studies seeking to examine the association between inactivity and the development of chronic health problems need to examine a diverse range of activities that comprehensively measure sedentariness. This information will provide a better understanding of inactivity patterns among adolescent girls. },

The aim of this study was to investigate whether physical activity (PA) is related to W in adolescents as previously shown in adults. Design and Subjects: Cross-sectional population-based survey of 2714 12-y-old adolescents from the eastern part of France. MEASUREMENTS: Body mass index (BMI) and W were measured. Structured PA, active commuting to and from school and sedentary activities (SED), for example television viewing, computer/video games and reading and different potential confounders (dietary habits, parental overweight, family annual income tax and educational level) were assessed by a questionnaire. Results: The adolescents had a mean BMI of 19.0+/-3.4 kg/m(2), and 20.2\% of them were overweight, with no gender difference. Boys had a greater W than girls (67.6+/-9.1 vs 65.7+/-8.9 cm, P<0.0001). In all, 42\% of the girls and 25\% of the boys did not practice any structured PA outside school and less than 40\% of the adolescents commuted actively to school more than 20 min/day. About one-third of the adolescents devoted more than 2 h/day to SED. In univariate analyses, BMI was negatively associated with structured PA but significantly only for girls (P<0.01) and positively associated with SED for both genders (P<0.0001 for girls, P<0.01 for boys). W was negatively associated with structured PA and positively associated with SED both in girls (P<0.0001 and P=0.03, respectively) and boys (P<0.01 and P=0.08, respectively). Multiple general linear models show that SED is associated with BMI, independently of structured PA, in both genders. On the other hand, structured PA was inversely associated with W, independently of SED. The inverse relation between structured PA and W persisted after additional adjustment on BMI, with a greater effect of PA for the adolescents with higher BMI. Conclusions: In 12-y-old adolescents, structured PA is inversely associated with W, an indicator of total adiposity but also more specifically of abdominal fat. This suggests that PA may have a beneficial effect on youth metabolic and cardiovascular risks, in particular in the presence of overweight.},

abstract = {Aim: To provide baseline data concerning the eating habits of young adolescents which will enable trends to be identified, the factors affecting food choice to be explored and a programme of intervention to be designed and evaluated. Methods: A dietary screening survey, delivered by computer, was completed by 707 schoolchildren aged 11-14 years attending schools in two of the least affluent areas of Liverpool. Eating habits were compared to two previous studies which used an identical computerized dietary survey method. Results: The results suggest that many children chose the least desirable foods, which is likely to result in them eating a poor quality diet. The most popular foods included snack foods such as crisps, chocolates and sweets, and sugared fizzy drinks and chips. A number of trends were noted: there was a decrease in the reported consumption of added sugar and high-fibre cereals, and an increase in the use of low-fat milk. Boys claimed to be more active than girls, and there was an inverse relationship between physical activities and watching TV and playing computer games in girls. The results showed similar eating patterns and physical activity levels to those from other more complex studies. Conclusion: The responses of the children indicated, at the very least, some increasing awareness of healthy eating messages, but whether changes in behaviour were occurring is less clear. There is still, however, scope for further positive change in eating habits and the survey will be repeated at regular intervals to examine trends.},

An exploratory factor analysis revealed a five factor model of user motivations-Achievement, Relationship, Immersion, Escapism, and Manipulation-illustrating the multifaceted appeal of these online environments. Male players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Achievement and Manipulation factors, while female players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Relationship factor.

In this paper, we begin by discussing some of the statistics that reveal electronic gaming\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s place as a major force in today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s economy. We next discuss two of the major problems involved with the usage of video games as a tool for teaching and learning in digital media: the issues of inconsistency and complexity. Gee\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s pioneering work (2004) is used to establish some principles of gaming that transcend these problems and present a unique medium with which to examine the nature of digital media and its principles and tools. We expand upon Gee\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s work to suggest specific ways that video games can be used to teach digital media students about a particular subset of digital media \{$\backslash$textendash\} in this case, that of project management, and speculate as to how this might be done in several genres of gaming. We conclude with a brief case study of our experiences in working with digital media students to build a video game that was used to teach fourth graders about African-American history and the Underground Railroad.

Then they competed with a confederate in a reaction time task that allowed for provocation and retaliation. Punishment levels set by participants for their opponents served as the measure of aggression. The results confirmed our hypothesis that playing the violent game would result in more aggression than would playing the nonviolent game.

Compared to traditional single view compositing methods, which either do not deal with the shadow effects or manually create the shadows for the composited objects, our approach efficiently utilizes the geometric and photometric constraints extracted from a single target image to synthesize the shadows consistent with the overall target scene for the inserted objects. In particular, we explore (i) the constraints provided by imaged scene structure, e.g. vanishing points of orthogonal directions, for camera calibration and thus explicit determination of the locations of the camera and the light source; (ii) the relatively weaker geometric constraint, the planar homology, that models the imaged shadow relations when explicit camera calibration is not possible; and (iii) the photometric constraints that are required to match the color characteristics of the synthesized shadows with those of the original scene. For each constraint, we demonstrate the working examples followed by our observations. To show the accuracy and the applications of the proposed method, we present the results for a variety of target scenes, including footage from commercial Hollywood movies and 3D video games.},

abstract = {The rate at which frames are rendered in a computer game directly impacts player performance, influencing both the game playability and enjoyability. However, despite the importance of frame rate and the wide-spread popularity of computer games, to the best of our knowledge, there is little quantitative understanding of the effects of frame rate on player performance in computer games. This paper provides a unique classification of actions in First Person Shooter (FPS) games based on interaction requirements that allow qualitative assessment of the impact of frame rates on player performance. This qualitative assessment is supported by quantitative analysis from two large user studies that measure the effects of frame rate on the fundamental player actions in a FPS game. Nearly 100 users participated in the two user study experiments, providing performance and perception data over a range of frame rates commonly studied for video streaming and inclusive of frame rates found in many computer game platforms. In general, the analysis shows that actions that require precise, rapid response, such as shooting, are greatly impacted by degradations in frame rates, while actions with lower precision and response requirements, such as moving, are more tolerant of low frame rates. These insights into the effects of frame rates on player performance can guide players in their choice for game settings and new hardware purchases, and inform system designers in their development of new hardware.

Second, it is pretty universally accepted that Kripke's Wittgenstein is a 'non-factualist' about ascriptions of meaning.

Despite students\&\#39; best efforts to hide their play, in-class gaming is rarely clandestine; the phenomenon is easily detectable from across the room by the \&quot;game glaze\&quot; on players\&\#39; faces. The intensity and ubiquity of this play, as well as the proliferation of personal computers, cell phones, PDAs and other gaming devices in college classrooms, prompted us to ask how we might use games to our pedagogical advantage.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects on several physiological (arterial pressure and heart rate) and psychological (anxiety and aggressiveness) indexes of playing violent and non-violent videogames in young adults. The study was carried out on a sample of 22 male participants. Subjects invited to participate in the study were recruited from a videogame leisure club. Before and during playing either a violent or non-violent computer game, blood pressure and heart rate were measured. Before and after the game session, the subjects completed the State-Anxiety Inventory-Y (STAI-Y) and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. The results of the study showed a range of short-term effects of playing violent and non-violent videogames on arterial pressure and on the state anxiety of subjects, but not on hostility measurements. More specifically, the group that played the violent videogames showed a significant increase in the state anxiety score at the end of the game, as compared to the pre-game self-evaluation, and an increase in the systolic blood pressure while the subjects were playing as compared to pre- and post-game values. A decrease in diastolic blood pressure after playing any game was also found.},

To tie these two threads together and account for the use of these environments for the development of expertise and credentials, the author proposes adding a third form, cultural capital, to the mix and outlines a model for understanding capital in all its manifestations: material, social, and cultural. This model will make it possible to explore how actors within synthetic worlds transform, or parlay, these forms from one into the other and how these forms are used across all the domains wherein users act, blurring any qualitative distinction between virtual and real worlds.},

Unfortunately, any test may increase students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} learning anxiety. Therefore, the study aims to find out how to improve efficiency of collaborative learning activities in a classroom without losing the expected objectives. First, the Team-Game-Tournament (TGT) collaborative learning strategy was selected to complement the computer-assisted test. Then, we can use a questionnaire to show that there is no significant increase on learning anxiety after using computer-assisted testing. It? other words, additional testing in collaborative learning is harmless to students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} learning anxiety. Finally, the time spent on learning a topic of experimental group was compared with control group to demonstrate the improvement of efficiency.

Players tend to have the same performance and consistency expectations of their online multiplayer games as they do of their single player games, without realizing the issues and problems introduced by networking their games together. This results in a tremendous challenge for developers of networked games, because issues such as latency work strongly against meeting the needs of players. In this paper, we discuss the concept of optimistic execution to help game developers mask or hide the effects of latency in their networked games. We introduce the notion of optimistic execution, present our work in this area, dubbed New HOPE, and comment on its ability to assist game developers in this important area.},

abstract = {For many users, the first real encounter with a computer occurs when taking an introductory course to computers at a college. To the extent that these training courses impact user understanding and motivation, they are important determinants of the user attitudes towards computers and merit serious assessment. Using 327 business undergraduates at two universities in the US, this paper reports on the reactions of students to computers and computer-related tasks before and after an introductory course to computers. Responses to a 20-item scale were analysed to examine the pattern of attitude change experienced by students in their training course. Factor analysis revealed five constructs for describing patterns of computer user attitude: negative reaction to computers; positive reaction to computers; reaction to computers for children education; reaction to computer-mediated services; and reaction to computer games. Four factors show significant change in mean scores after the training courses. The attitudes changed for males more than females, indicating improvement in attitudes. The respondents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} attitude to computer-mediated services remained unchanged. While the directions of changes indicate an overall improvement in respondents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} reactions, many attitudes did not change significantly after having taken the training courses. This may be due to the content or the format of these courses.},

Building on constructions of consumer behavior as both a sense-making activity and a resource for the construction of daydreams, as well as anthropological readings of performance, the authors speculate that many performances during digital play are products of consumer fantasy. The authors develop an interpretation of the relationship between the real and the virtual that is better equipped to understand the movement between consumer daydreams and those practices actualized in the material and now also in digital virtual reality. The authors argue that digital virtual performances present opportunities for liminoid transformations through inversions, speculations, and playfulness acted out in aesthetic dramas. To illustrate, the authors consider specific examples of the theatrical productions available to consumers in digital spaces, highlighting the consumer imagination that feeds them, the performances they produce, and the potential for transformation in consumer-players.},

It presents samples of mothers in gaming discourse \{$\backslash$textendash\} from TV, Music-video, forums, and ads. Mothers have been largely invisible in popular gaming discourse or formulaically portrayed as unsympathetic to/ policing the gaming habits of other family members. Now, gaming companies increasingly target women and families, female gamers exceed 40 \% of players (US and Sweden), and console gaming is displacing TV-watching as the core living-room activity. The Boy-nerd-in-the-Bedroom is, at least statistically, being dispelled and complemented by the Girl-into-Gaming. Still, a tenacious nineteenth-century icon lingers: the Angel-in-the-House. Mothers today do more than bring Hot Pockets to gaming kids (South Park WoW-Episode) or serve as the implied inferior player populating taunts like \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}My Momma shoots better than you\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} (Q3A). Mothers game too.

On the one hand, the population of the Web and our PCs with characters who reflect us can be seen as a humanization of a previously purely mechanical interface. On the other hand, the mechanization of subjectivity carried the danger of simply reducing the human to the machine. The author argues that predominant artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to modeling agents are based on an erasure of subjectivity analogous to that which appears when people are subjected to institutionalization. The result is agent behavior that is fragmented, depersonalized, lifeless and incomprehensible. Approaching the problem using a hybrid of critical theory and AI agent technology, the author argues that agent behavior should be narratively understandable; she presents a new agent architecture that structures behavior to be comprehensible as narrative.},

Often, researchers analyze instrumented behavior in isolation from other data. The problem with collecting instrumented behaviors without attitudinal, demographic, and contextual data is that researchers have no way to answer the ‘why’ behind the ‘what.’ We have combined the collection and analysis of behavioral instrumentation with other HCI methods to develop a system for Tracking Real-Time User Experience (TRUE). Using two case studies as examples, we demonstrate how we have evolved instrumentation methodology and analysis to extensively improve the design of video games. It is our hope that TRUE is adopted and adapted by the broader HCI community, becoming a useful tool for gaining deep insights into user behavior and improvement of design for other complex systems.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the video and computer game play patterns of young adolescent boys and girls, including factors correlated with playing violent games. Methods: Data collected in November/December, 2004 from children in grades 7 and 8 at two demographically diverse schools in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, using a detailed written self-reported survey. Results: Of 1254 participants (53\% female, 47\% male), only 80 reported playing no electronic games in the previous 6 months. Of 1126 children who listed frequently played game titles, almost half (48.8\%) played at least one violent (mature-rated) game regularly (67.9\% of boys and 29.2\% of girls). One third of boys and 10.7\% of girls play games nearly every day; only 1 in 20 plays often or always with a parent. Playing M-rated games is positively correlated (p \&lt; .001) with being male, frequent game play, playing with strangers over the Internet, having a game system and computer in one\&\#39;s bedroom, and using games to manage anger. Conclusions: Most young adolescent boys and many girls routinely play M-rated games. Implications for identifying atypical and potentially harmful patterns of electronic game use are discussed, as well as the need for greater media literacy among parents.

In response, this article develops a conceptual framework for how games might foster civic learning of many kinds.

This framework suggests an agenda for game design and research that could illuminate whether and how games can be most fruitfully incorporated into training and education for democratic citizenship and civic leadership.},

abstract = {Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games are highly successful, in terms of sales, and their content is part of an explicit business strategy which aims to exploit the latest technologies and platforms to develop content aimed at adult game players in certain markets. By all accounts this has been a highly successful strategy with the GTA franchise selling more than 30 million units across platforms by 2004, even before Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (GTA SA) was launched in late 2004 (Take Two Interactive 2004). The latter was the top selling console game in the USA and in the top ten in the UK in 2005. At the same time the GTA series are arguably the most maligned of game products in many markets attracting much negative commentary and numerous legal actions in the USA. This chapter argues that the GTA case demonstrates a key tension within the cultural industries between the need to maximise sales globally and the need to conform to, or be seen to conform to, local distribution, social and moral systems. At the same time the story demonstrates that despite the widespread rhetoric of free trade and the dismantling of state sanctioned censorship systems in the USA, most parts of Europe and Australia, the censorship of cultural products continues and is perhaps a less overt, but nonetheless, highly political, socially negotiated and nationally specific process.

Given the increasingly heavy use of portable consoles as an alternative to traditional television-style monitors, it is important to investigate how physiological and psychological effects of portable consoles may differ from those of television-based consoles, because such differences in physiological and psychological responses may precipitate differences in the delivered content\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s effectiveness. Because portable consoles are popular as a delivery system for multiple types of media content, such as movies and video games, it is also important to investigate whether differences between the effects of portable and television-based consoles are consistent across multiple types of media. This article reports a 2\{$\backslash$texttimes\}2 (console: portable or television-based\{$\backslash$texttimes\}medium: video game or movie) mixed factorial design experiment with physiological arousal and self-reported flow experience as dependent variables, designed to explore whether console type affects media experiences and whether these effects are consistent across different media. Results indicate that portable media consoles evoke lower levels of physiological arousal and flow experience and that this effect is consistent for both video games and movies. These findings suggest that even though portable media consoles are often convenient compared to television-based consoles, the convenience may come at a cost in terms of the user experience.},

Currently the motion of entities is often planned using a combination of scripting, grid-search methods, local reactive methods and flocking. In this paper we describe a novel approach, based on a technique originating from robotics, that computes a roadmap of smooth, collision-free navigation paths. Because the vast amount of computation time is spent in the pre-processing phase, navigation during the execution of an application is almost instantaneous. The created roadmap can be queried to obtain high quality paths. Furthermore, the applications of the roadmap are not limited to navigating an entity. Therefore, besides navigation for an entity, two other applications are presented; one for planning the motion of groups of entities and one for creating smooth camera movements through an environment. All applications are based on the same underlying techniques.},

Building on Hans-Georg Gadamer’s notion of games as a subject that “masters the players”, the paper will go beyond the traditional split between the social sciences’ real players and the aesthetics/humanities critical author-as-player, and present a theory of the player and player studies that incorporates the complex tensions between the real, historical player and the game’s human components. Since games are both aesthetic and social phenomena, a theory of the player must combine both social and aesthetic perspectives to be successful. The tension between the humanities and the social sciences over who controls the idea of the player can be found mirrored also in the struggle between the player as individual and the “player function” of the game. Transgressive play, the struggle against the game’s ideal player, far from being a marginal, romanticized phenomenon, is the core expression of this struggle.},

the exploration of a new environment can provide a success experience that 
leads to increased feelings of competence and mastery. Such experiences are 
considered important in the rehabilitation of forensic clients. 
The findings from videogame research within a general population are 
compared with those among mental health and forensic clients. Within the 
general population, videogames may provide opportunities for social 
interaction and the expression of creativity and humour as well as offering a 
graded approach to building computer skills. Within a forensic population, 
videogames have been found to be a normalising, age-appropriate and 
culturally appropriate activity, useful in engaging clients and improving 
self-concept and locus of control. 
The findings suggest that videogame play offers access to a safe virtual 
environment that encourages exploration and mastery and that it may be a 
useful therapeutic tool in secure settings where such opportunities are often 
limited. The use and potential contraindications of videogames within a 
forensic setting, the content of certain games and their possible influence on 
behaviour and the implications for future research are also discussed. },

While the participant gleaned information about immunity from the game without facilitator assistance, postgame debriefings aided the participant in reflection about the game. This was the first study to utilize a combination of postgame written and oral debriefing in the Nobel Prize Web-based game genre.

The integration objective has been to maintain the Fly3D main structure and functionality, changing only the events management. The videogames objects behavior and interconnection is modeled by message passing. Maintaining the videogame quality, the videogames created using DFly3D allow to reduce the computer power used to execute it.

abstract = {The paper presents theoretical foundations of the author's approach to the design of edu-larps. It is deliberately steering away from cross-disciplinary teaching, artistic education or soft skills training in order to advocate larps tailored to single school subjects, focused on integration and consolidation of curricular knowledge. Putting larp in the context of applied drama, or Drama in Education, the text argues that well-designed edu-larp is likely to be accepted by the average teacher, not just by dedicated and trained drama educators. The concept of print-and-play “larp for dummies” downplays the importance of preparation, acting and immersion, while emphasising the game-like structure of goals and conflicts: gameplay set to work alongside role-play. Therefore, the ideas and tools borrowed from video games and board games design can be useful in the creation of edu-role plays, breeding a form which might be called 'gamified drama'. The recommended function for edu-larps is final revision of a large textbook unit, an idea discussed on the example of high-school history classes. The suggested model for classrom larp is a negotiation game between conflicted but cooperating factions, divided into three stages: a) preparation of all factions separately; b) informal meeting of all factions shortly before the official talks; c) official negotiation session which is supposed to bring forward all major (textbook-based!) issues for public debate. The paper ends with a section on troubleshooting, i.e. an overview of risk factors frequently pointed in the discussion of game-based learning, with ideas of how to eliminate or minimise the risks through careful design. Referenced sources come from the fields of edu- larp, edu-drama, game-based learning, and general educational theory.},

abstract = {This paper examines the fan movement surrounding Lara Croft, a computer- generated character who has appeared in computer games, comic books, men\&\#39; s magazines, promotional tours, music videos, calendars, action figures and motion pictures. A fixture of the pop-culture landscape since 1996, Croft embodies or incarnates a nexus of cultural, economic, and technological forces, whose shared characteristic is their powerful hold on a vast audience base. Lara Croft is nothing without her fans. As the founding member of a new mode of celebrity system featuring female digital stars, Croft\&\#39;s essentially technological nature - the mode of her signification and circulation - produces continuities and ruptures with traditional fan practices, reframing our understandings of categories such as \&quot;fan\&\#39;, \&quot;audience\&\#39;, \&quot;character\&\#39;, and \&quot;text\&\#39; in relation to a mediascape whose speed and multiplicity mark not just postmodernism, but adaptive responses to postmodernity. From this perspective, Lara Croft is less a singular entity than a coping strategy, a mediation of media. The concerns of this project are, first, to examine Lara Croft as a conjunction of industrial and representational forces intended to promote certain types of reception and consumption; second, to assess the ways in which her peculiar semiotic status - simultaneously open-ended and concrete - renders her available for appropriation and elaboration by fans; and, finally, to discuss the ways in which Croft\&\#39;s fandom opens up new debates about the relationship between texts, audiences, and technology.

abstract = {In most modern video games, character behavior is scripted; no matter how many times the player exploits a weakness, that weakness is never repaired. Yet, if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve as the game is played, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications through interactive and adapting games.},

Several agents can communicate to share information in order to find the target efficiently.Particle filtering has been widely applied in game AI, because it is an e\{$\backslash$textpm\}cient, nonparametric method to learn from observations and is effective even for nonlinear, non-Gaussian state space distribution. In this project, I apply particle filters on state estimation for each individual game agent and on the communication in multi-agent settings.

Responses were coded in terms of amount of negative and violent content. Results indicate that those male participants reading the violent comic books responded more negatively on the ambiguous provocation story questions than male participants reading the mildly violent comic books.

abstract = {A representative sample of players of a popular massively multiplayer online game (World of Warcraft) was interviewed to map out the social dynamics of guilds. An initial survey and network mapping of players and guilds helped form a baseline. Next, the resulting interview transcripts were reviewed to explore player behaviors, attitudes, and opinions; the meanings they make; the social capital they derive; and the networks they form and to develop a typology of players and guilds. In keeping with current Internet research findings, players were found to use the game to extend real-life relationships, meet new people, form relationships of varying strength, and also use others merely as a backdrop. The key moderator of these outcomes appears to be the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s mechanic, which encourages some kinds of interactions while discouraging others. The findings are discussed with respect to the growing role of code in shaping social interactions.},

The author shows that the mythic plays a primary role in making a consistent fantasy world in terms of game play, morality, culture, time, and environment. It provides a rationale for players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} actions, as well as the logic that under- pins the stylistic profile of the game, its objects, tasks, and characters. In terms of the "cultural" environments of the game, the presence of a coherent and extensive myth scheme is core to the way differences and conflicts between races are organized. And, as a form of intertextual resonance, its mythology furnishes the game with a "thickness" of meaning that promotes, for players, a sense of mythological being as well as encouraging an in-depth textual engagement.},

Although this activity reportedly has many adverse effects on child development, these effects remain controversial. To investigate the effect of video game playing on regional cerebral blood volume, we measured cerebral hemoglobin concentrations using near-infrared spectroscopy in 12 normal volunteers consisting of six children and six adults. A Hitachi Optical Topography system was used to measure hemoglobin changes. For all subjects, the video game Donkey Kong((R)) was played on a Game Boy((R)) device. After spectroscopic probes were positioned on the scalp near the target brain regions, the participants were asked to play the game for nine periods of 15 s each, with 15-s rest intervals between these task periods. Significant increases in bilateral prefrontal total-hemoglobin concentrations were observed in four of the adults during video game playing. On the other hand, significant decreases in bilateral prefrontal total-hemoglobin concentrations were seen in two of the children. A significant positive correlation between mean oxy-hemoglobin changes in the prefrontal region and those in the bilateral motor cortex area was seen in adults. Playing video games gave rise to dynamic changes in cerebral blood volume in both age groups, while the difference in the prefrontal oxygenation patterns suggested an age-dependent utilization of different neural circuits during video game tasks.},

These online environments could potentially be unique research platforms for the social sciences and clinical therapy, but it is crucial to first establish that social behavior and norms in virtual environments are comparable to those in the physical world. In an observational study of Second Life, a virtual community, we collected data from avatars in order to explore whether social norms of gender, interpersonal distance (IPD), and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments even though the modality of movement is entirely different (i.e., via keyboard and mouse as opposed to eyes and legs). Our results showed that established findings of IPD and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments: ( 1) male-male dyads have larger IPDs than female-female dyads, ( 2) male-male dyads maintain less eye contact than female-female dyads, and ( 3) decreases in IPD are compensated with gaze avoidance as predicted by the Equilibrium Theory. We discuss implications for users of online games as well as for social scientists who seek to conduct research in virtual environments.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an initial user feedback study of the Road Rager prototype. Road Rager is a mixed reality game, designed to enable passengers in different cars to play against each other during an encounter in traffic. We are concerned with how to design a game which balances the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s focus of attention between traffic and the computer interfaces, to provide a game which is comprehensive, interesting and challenging during a very limited lifetime. The study shows that a tangible user interface enables the player to handle the interaction in the game while watching for cars in the vicinity. Further, the users found multiplayer gaming during brief encounters exciting. However, the study also showed that minimalism is critical to the design. The gestures should preferably be indexical rather than symbolic, and elaborate forms of identification as a condition for manipulative success should be avoided. Finally, tangible user interfaces also allow a type of gaming where players only focus on the computers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} interface, which suppresses the experience of combining traffic interaction with computer interaction.

This study examined predictors of various types of self-reported use of violent media content by 8th graders (N= 3,127)from 20 schools around the U.S. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that gender, sensation seeking, aggression, and frequency of Internet use had relatively strong contributions to explaining the use of violent media content composite and the measure of violent website content use. Alienation variables contributed significantly, though modestly, to variance explained in the use of violence-oriented websites, but not to the composite measure. Alienation from school and family also appeared to partially mediate effects of sensation seeking and aggression on use of violent Internet content. A negative feedback loop model for linking uses and gratifications approaches to the study of effects of violent media content on adolescents is suggested.},

Meta-analytic reviews reveal a small but noticeable association between playing violent video games and aggressive reactions. However, evidence for causal associations is still rare. In a novel, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 13 male research participants were observed playing a latest-generation violent video game. Each participant\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s game play was recorded and content analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis. Onscreen activities were coded as either "passive/dead, no a frame interactions"; "active/safe, no imminent danger/no violent interactions"; "active/potential danger occurs, violent interactions expected"; "active/under attack, some violent interactions"; and "active/fighting and killing, many violent interactions." Previous studies in neuroscience on aggressive thoughts and behaviors suggested that virtual violence would suppress affective areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala subsequent to activity variations at cognitive areas of the ACC. Comparison of game play activities with and without virtual violence in 11 participants confirmed the hypothesis. The rather large observed effects can be considered as caused by the virtual violence. We discuss the applicability of neuroscience methodology in media effects studies, with a special emphasis on the assumption of virtuality prevalent in video game play.},

The present article discusses the applicability of the notions of meta-game and meta-gaming in understanding the patterns of how people use, misuse, work and work-around information and information infrastructures. Method. Twenty-two qualitative interviews of archives, library and museum professionals conducted in two Nordic countries in 2009-2011. The interviews were semi-structured and based on the thematic interview approach of Hirsj\"{a}rvi and Hurme as a part of a larger study of the information work of such professionals. Analysis. An exploratory qualitative analysis based on constant comparative method was carried out on the interview data. Results. The analysis shows that the information work of the interviewed professionals contained a large number of examples of different types of meta-gaming. Conclusions. The analysis suggests that the notions of meta-games and meta-gaming can be used to explain peripheral and second-order information activities and to analyse the aspects of work that relate to gameplay and playfulness.},

abstract = {Player-created game movies have been an outlet for creative expression by World of Warcraft (WoW) players since the beta version of the game. The proliferation of players, clans, Web sites, and community forums for creating, consuming, and commenting on WoW movies is remarkable. Linking multiplayer game communities and the making of animated movies is not unprecedented. It has been a characteristic of machinima for more than a decade. In this article however, the author hopes to show that the context, content, and consumption of game movies based on massively multiplayer games raises new questions about contributions game-based performances make to player communities. The author connects the brief history of WoW movies to the history of machinima and other game movies, illustrates the variety of impulses behind WoW movies through three quickly recounted examples, and gathers together salient themes around one movie in particular: Tristan Pope\&\#39;s Not Just Another Love Story.

abstract = {As the Internet has become rapidly and widely integrated into society, Internet addiction has become a growing psychosocial problem. However, epileptic seizure, another out-of-the-ordinary health problem, is often neglected in this regard. Ten patients who experienced epileptic seizures while playing the newest genre of electronic games-Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs)-were investigated. Patients were predominantly male young adults, and most of the events were generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures, and absences. These patients should be categorized into idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Even though photosensitivity was an important factor, behavioral and higher mental activities also seemed to be significant seizure precipitants. Results demonstrated that MMORPG-induced seizures were not analogous to the ordinary video game-induced seizures. Significantly, an epileptic seizure warning did not always appear on the websites of MMORPGs and instructions for the software. While the prevalence of MMORPG-induced seizures remains unknown, it may exceed our expectations and impact our society. Not only for clinical neurologists but also for the primary physicians, educators, sociologists, and global online game publishers, there should be an awareness of this special form of reflex seizures in order to provide an appropriate health warning to MMORPG players.},

abstract = {Despite being the focus of academic studies for close to two decades and a signifi- cant part of popular culture for much longer, the humanities generally and cultur- al studies in particular lacks a coherent vocabulary to perform strong, analytical criticism of individual videogame works. The solution is not another prescriptive, top-down model that attempts to understand all videogame play the same way, but a descriptive, bottom-up conceptual toolkit that understands particular videogames in the moment of play when videogame and player come together. This article high- lights the values inherited by game studies that have resisted the creation of such a toolkit and suggests one path forward grounded in the phenomenological pleasures of videogame play across worlds and bodies. After exploring game studies’ historical hostility to critical and textual readings, it conceptualises the ‘videogame text’—the critic’s object of study—as the coming together of the player and the videogame in a cybernetic circuit of embodied pleasures. This circuit flows across both the actual and virtual worlds of play in a convergence of form and content. Ultimately, this article lays a groundwork for academic roads into videogame criticism that is primarily concerned with understanding videogames as videogames to complement those ad-hoc methods already being developed by a nascent scene of online critics and bloggers.},

abstract = {Computer games have been around for almost as long as computers. Most of these games, however, have been designed in a rather ad hoc manner because many of their basic components have never been adequately defined. In this paper some deficiencies in the standard model of computer games, the minimax model, are pointed out and the issues that a general theory must address are outlined. Most of the discussion is done in the context of control strategies, or sets of criteria for move selection. A survey of control strategies brings together results from two fields: implementations of real games and theoretical predictions derived on simplified game-trees. The interplay between these results suggests a series of open problems that have arisen during the course of both analytic experimentation and practical experience as the basis for a formal theory.

abstract = {With the proliferation of hedonic information systems, understanding users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} acceptance of hedonic information systems has become a new topic for practitioners and academics. While perceived playfulness or perceived enjoyment has been found to have a significant influence on the behavioral intention to use hedonic information systems, little research has been conducted to Investigate empirically the antecedents of perceived playfulness and the mediating role that perceived playfulness has in user acceptance of hedonic information systems. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role of perceived playfulness in the psychological process of user acceptance of hedonic online game systems. Based on previous literature, two individual difference variables (i.e., computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety) and three system characteristics variables (i.e., challenge, feedback, and speed) were proposed as potential antecedents of perceived playfulness in the context of massive multiplayer online games. The results indicate that perceived playfulness plays a partial mediating role in the relationship of system characteristics and individual differences to behavioral intention. Both challenge and computer self-efficacy were found to have a significant influence on behavioral intention via perceived playfulness, with computer self-efficacy also having a direct influence on behavioral intention. Computer anxiety, however, was only found to have a direct influence on behavioral intention. Also, neither feedback nor speed was found to have a significant effect on perceived playfulness. The results of this study provide several important implications for research and practices of hedonic information systems/online game design and promotion.},

It describes the permeation of economic, political, and social contexts by game-elements such as awards, rule structures, and interfaces that are inspired by video games. Sometimes the term is reduced to the implementation of points, badges, and leaderboards as incentives and motivations to be productive. Sometimes it is envisioned as a universal remedy to deeply transform society toward more humane and playful ends. Despite its use by corporations to manage brand communities and personnel, however, gamification is more than just a marketing buzzword. States are beginning to use it as a new tool for governing populations more effectively. It promises to fix what is wrong with reality by making every single one of us fitter, happier, and healthier. Indeed, it seems like all of society is up for being transformed into one massive game. The contributions in this book offer a candid assessment of the gamification hype. They trace back the historical roots of the phenomenon and explore novel design practices and methods. They critically discuss its social implications and even present artistic tactics for resistance. It is time to rethink gamification!},

(a) Visual stimulation that resembles the stimulation normally responsible for seizures, such as that from televisions or videogames, both of which typically use cathode ray tubes in which the display is created in a flickering pattern. Such stimulation is often rendered yet more epileptogenic by programmes with content that also involves flashing or patterned material. (b) Elementary visual stimuli that enable inferences to be drawn concerning the physiological trigger mechanisms. The topographic distribution of epileptiform EEG activity in response to such stimuli has complemented this approach, leading to the inference that the trigger is cortical and requires sychronised mass action of neurons. (c) Stimuli that avoid paroxysmal EEG activity and permit an investigation of the subepileptic response to visual stimuli, using the evoked potential. This has revealed abnormalities in the cortical mechanisms that control the response to strong visual stimulation.},

However, the auto-playing programs, either software or hardware, do harm to games servers in various ways including abuse of resources. In this paper, we propose a way of detecting the auto programs by analyzing the window event sequences produced by the game players. In our proposed method, the event sequences are transformed into a set of attributes, and various leaming algorithms are applied to classify the data represented by the set of attribute values into human or auto player. The results from experiments with several MMORPGs show that the Decision Tree learning with proposed method can identify the auto-playing programs with high accuracy.

abstract = {A general method for the generation of natural language narrative is described. It allows the expression, or narrative discourse, to vary independently of the underlying events and existents that are the narrative's content. Specifically, this variation is accomplished in an interactive fiction (IF) system which replies to typed input by narrating what has happened in a simulated world. IF works have existed for about 30 years as forms of text-based computer simulation, instances of dialog systems, and examples of literary art. Theorists of narrative have carefully distinguished between the level of underlying content (corresponding to the simulated world in interactive fiction) and that of expression (corresponding to the textual exchange between computer arnd user) since the mid-1960s, when the field of narratology began to develop, but IF systems have not yet made use of this distinction. The current project contributes new techniques for automatic narration by building on work done in computational linguistics, specifically natural language generation, and in narratology. First, types of narrative variation that are possible in IF are identified and formalized in a way that is suitable for a natural language generation system. An architecture for an IF system is then described and implemented; the result allows multiple works of interactive fiction to be realized and, using a general plan for narrating, allows them to be narrated in different ways during interaction. The system's ability to generate text is considered in a pilot evaluation. Plans for future work are also discussed. They include publicly released systems for IF development and narratology education, adding a planning capability that uses actors' individual perspectives, and adapting automatic narration to different sorts of interactive systems.},

The severity of these physical disabilities also limits assessment of their cognitive and language skills and abilities. The CRS robot manipulator was adapted for use by children who have disabilities. Our emphasis is on the technical control aspects of the development of an interface and communication environment between the child and the robot arm. The system is designed so that each child has user control and control procedures that are individually adapted. Control interfaces include large push buttons, keyboards, laser pointer, and head-controlled switches. Preliminary results have shown that young children who have severe disabilities can use the robotic arm system to complete functional play-related tasks. Developed software allows the child to accomplish a series of multistep tasks by activating one or more single switches. Through a single switch press the child can replay a series of preprogrammed movements that have a development sequence. Children using this system engaged in three-step sequential activities and were highly responsive to the robotic tasks. This was in marked contrast to other interventions using toys and computer games.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of computer gaming and its associated technologies are evidence of the increasing convergence of new technology and leisure practice. The size and popularity of the games industry stands out in contrast to the relative lack of understanding of computer gaming as a serious leisure activity. Previous research on computer gaming has tended to focus on the negative aspects of gaming such as aggression, addiction, and social isolation, rather than viewing it as an activity which forms an important part of many peoples\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} leisure lifestyles. This paper examines the relationship between gender and the social and spatial organization of computer gaming. The concept of leisure constraints and resistance are utilised to examine the extent to which technologically-mediated leisure activities, such as computer gaming, are part of wider changes in female access to private and public leisure spaces. Computer gaming is still perceived as a highly gendered activity which has the potential to reinforce traditional conceptualizations of masculinity, femininity and associated leisure activities. However, the popularity of domestic and online gaming among females, and the development of female gaining clans, highlights that leisure activities and spaces are becoming less gendered, and can provide sites for resistance to societal notions of the gender appropriateness of leisure activities.},

abstract = {Gender-inclusivity in games has been a much debated issue and despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. Gender-inclusivity in games may support certain features and in turn may even determine the features of applications built based on it. This poses a challenge: although we have good techniques for analyzing, designing and evaluating current games, our techniques for gender-inclusive games are much less formed. This article seeks to better understand the components and sub-components of gender-inclusivity in games. It introduces the Gender-Inclusivity Framework (GIF), a conceptual framework that integrates the appropriate gender, games and design literature in order to enhance our knowledge of gender-inclusivity in games. The framework defines gender-inclusivity in three key components: (1) genre, which indicates the type of game, (2) gameplay, which describes the game behaviour and (3) content, which describes the game content. We present the definitions within the scope of gender-inclusivity in games and the detailed items related to each component.},

abstract = {Real time animation of human figures in virtual environments is an important problem in the context of computer games and virtual environments. Recently, the use of large collections of captured motion data has increased realism in character animation. However, assuming that the virtual environment is large and complex, the effort of capturing motion data in a physical environment and adapting them to an extended virtual environment is the bottleneck for achieving interactive character animation and control. We present a new technique for allowing our animated characters to navigate through a large virtual environment, which is constructed using a set of building blocks. The building blocks, called motion patches, can be arbitrarily assembled to create novel environments. Each patch is annotated with motion data, which informs what actions are available for animated characters within the block. The versatility and flexibility of our approach are demonstrated through examples in which multiple characters are animated and controlled at interactive rates in large, complex virtual environments.},

Subjects and methods: The sample consisted of 29 ADHD children and 21 controls aged between 6 and 16 years playing video games. We used the Child Behavior Checklist and the Problem Videogame Playing scale (PVP scale). This instrument gives objective measures of problem use, which can be considered as an indication of addictive videogame playing. We designed a questionnaire for the parents, eliciting qualitative information about their child\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s videogame playing. There were no significant differences concerning frequency or duration of play between ADHD children and controls but differences were observed on the PVP scale. None of the controls scored above four whereas 10 hyperactive children answered affirmatively to five or more questions. These children presented a greater intensity of the disorder than the other ADHD children. Conclusion: While no differences concerning video game use were found, ADHD children exhibited more problems associated with videogame playing. It seems that a subgroup of ADHD children could be vulnerable to developing dependence upon video games. $\backslash$copyright2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article presents conceptual and empirical analyses of several of the "best practices" of learning and instruction, and demonstrates how violent video games use them effectively to motivate learners to persevere in acquiring and mastering a number of skills, to navigate through complex problems and changing environments, and to experiment with different identities until success is achieved. These educational principles allow for the generation of several testable hypotheses, two of which are tested with samples of 430 elementary school children (mean age 10 years), 607 young adolescents (mean age 14 years), and 1,441 older adolescents (mean age 19 years). Participants were surveyed about their video game habits and their aggressive cognitions and behaviors. The first hypothesis is based on the principle that curricula that teach the same underlying concepts across contexts should have the highest transfer. Therefore, students who play multiple violent video games should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play fewer. The second hypothesis is based on the principle that long-term learning is improved the more practice is distributed across time. Therefore, students who play violent video games more frequently across time should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play the same types of games for equivalent amounts of time but less frequently. Both hypotheses were supported. We conclude by describing what educators can learn from the successful instructional and curriculum design features of video games. $\backslash$copyright2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

According to traditional marketing wisdom, players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} preferences are a core issue in creating successful products, and the game design process is crucial for guaranteeing players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} satisfaction. Then, an important question arises: What do players want in videogames? The purpose of this work is to propose a game design reference that directly mirrors players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} preference, shaped as a qualitative model based on empirical data gathered during playing sessions. The model describes the main elements that, according to players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} opinions, determine the playability of action videogames; the model proposes design guidelines that are the conceptualization of players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} preferences. Therefore, the model helps game designers to understand the elements that must be dealt with to make better games. Besides the operational relevance of the model, the research methodology described in this work is an example of how a qualitative approach such as the grounded theory paradigm can be applied to solve a software specification problem directly focusing on end-users.},

The data are converted into structures targeted directly to the hardware, and a code stream is assembled that describes the manipulations required to render these data structures. Our compiler is structured like a traditional code compiler, with a front end that reads the geometric data and attributes (hereafter referred to as an art asset) output from a 3D modeling package and shaders in a platform independent form and performs platform-independent optimizations, and a back end that performs platform-specific optimizations and generates platform-targeted data structures and code streams. Our compiler back-end has been targeted to four platforms, three of which are radically different from one another.

abstract = {According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I in 3 children born in 2000 in the United States will become diabetic. The odds are higher for African American and Hispanic children as nearly 50\% of them will develop diabetes. Random screening is not effective in identifying children at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): therefore, there is a need to apply screening strategies that guide the development of appropriate primary prevention efforts. To assess the prevalence of risk factors for T2DM, 1066 fifth-grade children were screened using American Diabetes Association guidelines. Overall, 22.6\% were found at risk; African American and Hispanic children were almost 8 times more likely, to be at risk when compared to Caucasians (odds ratio 7.41 and 7.87). Children who reported watching TV/playing video games 2 or more hours/day, were 73\% more likely, to be at risk. Children identified to be at risk were referred to their primary care provider and were invited to participate in a counseling session. The environmental risk factors for T2DM identified in this study are modifiable and should be targeted in preventive interventions at the school and community level to reduce overweight and consequently prevent 72DM in children, especially among minority children.},

It reflects on the changing fortunes of early digital games in terms of the shifts in esteem they undergo: from novelty to detritus, to partial recuperation as nostalgia item, based on the author\&\#39;s research into the history of such games in New Zealand. Drawing inspiration from Tom Gunning\&\#39;s analyses of the interrelation between technological novelty and the existence of a discourse that makes it possible to express such novelty, the author argues that while the present collector-led valorizing of game artifacts is significant, and the mercantile marketing of games from back-catalogues useful, there is an urgent need for discourses reflecting on digital games in relation to broader shifts in visual culture.

In this paper, we present techniques for the visual simulation and rendering of such effects that keep up with the demands for frame rates imposed by such environments. This is achieved by leveraging functionality on recent graphics programming units (GPUs) in combination with a novel approach to model non physics-based, yet realistic variations in flow fields. We show how to use this mechanism for simulating effects as demonstrated in Figure 1. Physics-based simulation is performed on 2D proxy geometries, and simulation results are extruded to 3D using particle or texture based approaches. Our method allows the animator to model and to flexibly control the dynamic behavior of volumetric effects, and it can be used to create plausible animations of a variety of natural phenomena.},

Impairment testing was viewed as more favorable in terms of combating and controlling counterproductive behaviors at work than drug testing. Perceptions of fairness, effectiveness in detecting impaired performance, and the potential to enhance a safer working environment were higher in the impairment testing condition as compared to the drug testing condition. Perceived invasiveness was lower in the impairment testing condition relative to the drug testing condition.

Good video games, it is assumed, have easy to use interfaces, but they also provide difficult gameplay challenges to the player. But must a good game follow this pattern, and what is the difference between interface and gameplay? When does the easy-to-use interface stop, and when does the challenging gameplay begin? By analyzing a number of games, the paper argues that it is rare to find a clear-cut border between interface and gameplay and that the fluidity of this border characterizes games in general. While this border is unclear, we also analyze a number of games where the challenge is unambiguously located in the interface, thereby demonstrating that "easy interface and challenging gameplay" is neither universal nor a requirement for game quality. Finally, the paper argues, the lack of a clear distinction between easy interface and challenging gameplay is due to the fact that games are fundamentally designed not to accomplish something through an activity, but to provide an activity that is pleasurable in itself.},

abstract = {Objective. To investigate the effectiveness of computerized virtual reality (VR) training of the hemiparetic hand of patients poststroke using a system that provides repetitive motor reeducation and skill reacquisition. Methods. Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. Results. Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. Conclusions. It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke. Computerized exercise systems may be a way to maximize both the patients\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and the clinicians\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} time. The data in this study add support to the proposal to explore novel technologies for incorporation into current practice.},

abstract = {Human navigation in an unknown environment requires an understanding of the spatial relationships of the terrain. For example, a soldier who is on a reconnaissance mission in a new city needs to "know" the spatial layout of the surroundings with high confidence. Oftentimes, this understanding must be acquired within a very short amount of time and with limited sensory inputs. The soldier would benefit from a digital avatar that draws inferences about the spatial layout of the city based on an initial set of observations and guides the soldier either in further exploring the environment or in making decisions based on these inferences. In this paper, we present and evaluate an inductive approach to learning spatial associations using sensory data that is available from the simulation environment of a computer game, Unreal Tournament. We study two kinds of spatial relationships between nodes on a level of a game map: nodes that are placed near each other to satisfy some spatial requirement and nodes that are placed near each other to satisfy the design preferences of a level architect. We show that we can infer both kinds of relationships using an association rule mining algorithm. Furthermore, we show how to use an ontology to distinguish between these relationships in order to discover different types of spatial arrangements on a specific map. We discuss how the inferred associations can be used to control an avatar that makes recommendations for navigating unexplored areas on a map. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our methods to scenarios in the real world, beyond the simulation environment of a game, and on how the learned associations can be represented and queried by a simple question-answer type system.},

The first, predominant in the literature on Gadamer, is built on the premise that we cannot surpass our historically situated prejudgments. The paper rejects this argument as insufficient. Similarly, the paper rejects a second argument concerning the heuristics of understanding. The paper then articulates a third argument that the object of understanding changes according to the conditions in which it is grasped. The paper appeals to the notion of relational properties to make sense of this claim and to defend the position against two objections: i) that it conflates meaning and significance, and ii) that it is saddled with an indefensible relativism.},

In search of a theme for a lecture allowing us to deal with technical and reflective aspects of something relevant for visualistics that would simultaneously gain a high level of motivation from the students, \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}computer game design\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} fell into our view, and proved, on careful examination, to be ideal for that purpose. This paper describes, as a case study, the background, structure, and effect of the resulting lecture.},

abstract = {One current theory of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) proposes that a primary deficit in behavioral inhibition gives rise to secondary deficits in 4 executive functions and motor control. To date, empirical support for this model is based primarily on laboratory-based cognitive methods. This study assessed behavioral inhibition and executive functioning in children with ADHD in 2 real-life contexts: videogames (motor-skill target game, cognitively demanding adventure game) and an outing at the zoo (route tasks). Participants were a community sample of 57 boys diagnosed with ADHD (20 inattentive, 37 combined type) and 57 normally developing control boys, matched individually for age and nonverbal IQ. Operationally defined measures of behavioral inhibition and specific executive functions were derived from these activities and assessed under contrasting conditions of low or high working memory and distractor loads. There were no group differences in basic motor skills on the target game, nor in terms of the ability to inhibit a prepotent or ongoing response in the adventure videogame. However, boys with ADHD exhibited more self-talk, more effortful response preparation, and completed fewer challenges in the latter videogame. Also, they manifested inhibition deficits in terms of interference control during the route task at the zoo and took longer to complete the tasks. Typically, these differences were greatest under conditions of high working memory and distractor loads. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive difficulties in ADHD may be context dependent and that ADHD is associated with deficits in some but not all aspects of behavioral inhibition.},

abstract = {Objective and methods: The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of excessive computer game playing behaviour among adolescents with psychopathological tendencies that resemble the classic symptoms of addiction. To address this question, criteria for excessive computer game playing behaviour were developed on the basis of diagnostic criteria for substance-related disorders according to ICD-10.Results: Excessive computer playing corresponding to addictive behaviour were found in 12.3\% of the adolescents (n = 1068; 9.6\% showed abusive and 2.7\% dependent behaviour). Adolescents with excessive computer and video game playing behaviour also show substantial correlations with other psychosocial and psychopathological abnormalities, such as alterations in the intensity of social conflict, concentration deficits, maladaptive coping behaviour, stress and psychosomatic challenge, and school phobia.Conclusions: The study provides the first empirical data about excessive computer game playing among adolescents in Austria. It shows that pathological computer game playing can be well described by criteria developed in accordance to substance dependence, and that abusive or dependent Computer game playing shows specific connections with psycho-social, psychopathological and motivational factors. Overall, the results demonstrate a clear need for deeper research on this subject and the need for a design of prevention measures.},

These titles were coded by genre, and differences in total time and in time spent with specific genres within each medium were examined. Main effects of age and sex on total use and use by genres are reported. Among other results, oldest boys were found to spend more time watching sports programs and playing electronic sports games while the oldest girls spend more time watching relationship dramas and not a large amount of time playing video games. The results indicate the diverging media interests of boys and girls. Use patterns may also suggest a lack of availability of appropriate electronic games for older girls.},

Two sixth grade classrooms of students between the ages 10 to 12 (46 students) participated in a participatory simulation of a virtual infectious disease as part of their science curriculum that took place in a university-laboratory school in Los Angeles, California. The results from our analyses revealed that the immersive components of the simulation afforded students the opportunity to discuss their understandings of natural disease and to compare them to their experiences with the virtual disease. We found that while the virtual disease capitalized on students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} knowledge of natural infectious disease through virtual symptoms, these symptoms and a missing curricular piece of computational viruses may have led students to think of its transfer more as an observable or mechanical event rather than as a biological process.

This paper offers six propositions for structure, causality, visibility and interaction, which appear to produce cognitive, emotive and sensory engagement in users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} reactions to a narrative multimedia design. The developmental approach was phenomenological. The propositions derive from a focus group study in which 12 users played with four commercial computer games, then we (and they) analysed their reactions. Two observations from the study inform the morphology of narrative. Firstly, there is a fundamental conflict between narrative in its traditional form and interactivity, and secondly, the primal features of narrative-causality temporality and linearity-are disrupted within a hyper structure. The first set of propositions suggests solutions for such conflicts. These are spatial containment, causality, and demands on user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s skills. Further propositions for engaging interaction are causality of dialogue, apparent intelligence of the program and hiding the delivery medium.},

Study design Telephone survey administered to 1454 parents of children <11 years old derived from a diverse clinic population. Results The mean age of the index child was 5.05 years. Mean daily reported child media use was as follows: television (1.45 hours; SD, 1.5); videos (1.1 hours; SD, 1.30); and computer games (0.54 hours; SD, 0.96). Thirty percent of parents reported that their child ate breakfast or dinner in front of the television in the past week, and 22\% were concerned about the amount of television that their child watched. In multivariate linear regression, eating breakfast or dinner in front of the television in the past week was associated with increased hours of television viewing (0.38 hours [0.21, 0.54]) and video (0.19 hours [0.04, 0.34]). Having a television in a child\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s bedroom was associated with increased hours of television (0.25 hours [0.07, 0.43]), video viewing (0.31 hours [0.16, 0.47]), and computer games (0.21 hours [0.10, 0.32]). In general, higher parental education was associated with decreased hours of television and video but not computer games. Older children were 2 to 3 times more likely than younger children to have a television in their bedroom and to have eaten a meal in front of it in the past week. More educated parents were less likely to report that their child had a television in their bedroom and more likely to be concerned about the amount of television their child viewed. Conclusions Combined video and computer game usage exceeded television usage. Both children of low- and high-income parents are at risk for certain behaviors associated with television usage. Parents whose children watched more television were more likely to be concerned about the amount of television their child viewed.},

The constritctionist design methodology (CDM)-so called because it advocates modular building blocks and incorporation of prior work-addresses factors that we see as key to future advances in At, including support for interdisciplinary collaboration, coordination of teams, and large-scale systems integration. We test the methodology by building an interactive multifunctional system with a real-time perception-action loop. The system, whose construction relied entirely on the methodology, consists of an embodied virtual agent that can perceive both real and virtual objects in an augmented-reality room and interact with a user through coordinated gestures and speech. Wireless tracking technologies give the agent awareness of the environment and the user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s speech and communicative acts. User and agent can communicate about things in the environment, their placement, and their function, as well as about more abstract topics, such as current news, through situated multimodal dialogue.

The emergence of localisation as a collection of new markets, a set of not so new skills, and a new frontier is the time for translators to decide where they stand and how much they are prepared to change, and for training institutions to adapt to the new challenges. That means that institutions must teach localisations as a matter of course but also reposition themselves more radically as schools of multilingual, multimedia engineering so that their trainees may keep abreast of changes that are already reshaping demand by work providers.},

We then go on to contrast the approaches taken by computer games to engage players with those of education to engage learners and ask whether there is any common ground. We further consider what sort of skills or knowledge could be acquired through the use of computer games with a particular emphasis on literacy. Finally we question current trends in the development of the virtual student learning space and suggest that some rethinking may be required if virtual learning environments are to be embraced by students.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: A total of 422 children (211 boys and 211 girls) aged between 5 and 10 years from primary schools in the City of Trois-Rivieres (Quebec) were selected to participate in this study. Measurements: Body weight, height and waist circumference were measured. The children were classified as normal, underweight, overweight or obese, according to body mass index (BMI) per age. An exhaustive questionnaire was administered by telephone to the parents of children. Results: The percentage of overweight/obesity was 20.0\% in boys and 24.0\% in girls. When compared to children reporting 12-13 h of sleep per day, the adjusted odds ratio for childhood overweight/obesity was 1.42 (95\% confidence interval 1.09-1.98) for those with 10.5-11.5 h of sleep and 3.45 (2.61-4.67) for those with 8-10 h of sleep after adjustment for age, sex, and other risk factors. Parental obesity, low parental educational level, low total family income, long hours of TV watching, playing videogames or computer utilization, absence of breastfeeding and physical inactivity were also significantly associated with childhood overweight/obesity. In addition, we observed a significant negative association adjusted for age between sleep duration and body weight (-0.33, P < 0.01), BMI (-0.12, P < 0.01) and waist circumference (-0.24, P < 0.01) in boys. Conclusion: An inverse association was observed between sleep duration and the risk to develop childhood overweight/obesity. Longitudinal research will be required to confirm a potential link of causality between these variables.},

that lighting assumes in game environments, including directing attention, establishing
good action visibility, evoking emotions, setting atmosphere, and providing depth.
Current lighting design techniques rely on static manually designed lighting, where designers
set up the positions, angles, and colors for each light in a level. Game environments are
dynamic and unpredictable; physical and narrative scene content, including character locations,
tension, and narrative goals, change unpredictably in real time due to user interaction.
Thus, current static techniques often do not adequately adapt to serve desired aesthetic and
communicative functions or perceptual effects. Recently, Doom 3 incorporated dynamic
real-time lighting and demonstrated many advantages of using real-time dynamic lighting in
games, including heightening the emotional engagement and enhancing the overall interactive
experience. However, the technique is scripted and tightly coupled to game content. In
this article, we present ELE (Expressive Lighting Engine), an intelligent lighting system that
automatically sets and adjusts scene lighting in real time to achieve aesthetic and communicative
functions, including evoking emotions, directing visual focus, and providing visibility
and depth. ELE operates as a separate system that interacts with game/graphics engines
through a standard interface. In this article, we will discuss ELE and its interface with Unreal
Tournament 2003. We will also present results showing ELE in action. These results show:
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Utility of real-time adaptive lighting in providing visual focus, setting atmosphere,
evoking emotions, and establishing visibility during interaction in interactive
environments
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Acceleration in the development process due to the introduction of an automatic
system for lighting that can be overridden by designers at a high level, thus eliminating
the time-consuming process of setting individual light parameters for each level and
scene.},

The experience of the authors with the initial offering of a games-based introductory programming course is also explained, along with the initial assessment of results from the experience. Our experience of using games-based learning in an introductory laboratory is presented. Finally, we demonstrate how games-based learning can be extended beyond the classroom as we work to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) with local elementary schools; our current project develops an ocean ecosystem exploration game that teaches oceanography and ecological sustainability.},

Most girls (93.7\%) and boys (94.7\%) reported using the Internet at both time periods, whereas more boys (80.3\%) than girls (28.8\%) reported gaming at both time periods. Girls reported a small decrease over time in the frequency of hours spent per day on overall technology use, mostly due to a decrease in gaming. Both linear and curvilinear relations were examined between parental relationships, friendship quality, academic orientation, and well-being measured in early high school and the frequency of technology use in late high school. Being male significantly predicted both computer gaming and Internet use. There also were trends in favor of higher friendship quality and less positive parental relationships predicting higher frequency of Internet use. Importantly, moderate use of the Internet was associated with a more positive academic orientation than nonuse or high levels of use. $\backslash$copyright2008 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {One goal of research in the area of human-machine interaction is to improve the ways a human user interacts with a computer through a multimedia interface. This interaction comprises of not only text, graphical animation, stereo sounds, and live video images, but also force and haptic feedback, which can provide more "real" feeling to the user. The force feedback joystick, a human interface device is an input-output device. It not only tracks user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physical manipulation input, but also provides realistic physical sensations of force coordinated with system output. As part of our research, we have developed a multimedia computer game that assimilates images, sounds, and force feedback. We focused on the issues of how to combine these media to allow the user feel the compliance, damping, and vibration effects through the force feedback joystick. We conducted series of human subject experiments that incorporated different combinations of media, including the comparative study of the different performances of 60 human users, aiming to answer the question: What are the effects of force feedback (and associated time delays) when used in combination with visual and auditory information as part of a multi-modal interface? It is hoped that these results can be utilized in the design of enhanced multimedia systems that incorporate force feedback.},

Performance on the tests was related to sex, age, education level, family income and race-ethnicity. Performance decreased as age increased, and increased as education level and family income increased. Differences in performance between sexes, levels of education and racial-ethnic groups tended to decrease as family income increased. The relationship between age and performance on the symbol-digit substitution test varied by education level and by racial-ethnic group. The relationship between age and performance on the serial digit learning test varied by racial-ethnic group. Questionnaire variables that were related to performance on one or more of the tests included the reported amount of last night\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s sleep, energy level, computer or video game familiarity, alcoholic beverages within the last 3 h and effort.

@article{4361,
abstract = {An important factor to consider in developing educational computer games concerns whether there are any differences between learners in their acceptance of games for learning. In particular there is concern that the strong male preference found in playing games for leisure might also extend to games-based learning, making males more accepting of games in learning than females.There is clear evidence that the violent content and competitive structure of many games, gender stereotyping of female characters, the lack of opportunities for meaningful social interaction between game characters and the visual skills required to succeed in many games are features of games that make them less appealing to females than to males. Games manufacturers have responded to criticisms that games are male-oriented by developing games which aim to appeal to both males and females. However they have also acknowledged that boys and girls essentially prefer different types of game and they have also developed games specifically targeted at girls. These preferences in computer games have helped to confirm that males and females have different interests and preferences which are very deep rooted and emerge in infancy. Woudheusen has argued that these preferences are resistant to change as they probably reflect biologically influenced inclinations which are crystallised by socialisation processes.While it is acceptable to develop different games for leisure for boys and girls, with games for learning the situation is more complex. Schools and universities need to be inclusive and new learning methods and materials should aim to be gender neutral. However games for learning are being introduced into a prevailing motivational climate in schools which suits the more committed and methodical approach of girls. Many boys subscribe to the "Not cool to study" view and this has led to a culture of underachievement and "laddishness" amongst boys. It is tempting to argue that the easy engagement and the active, competitive style of interaction required in many computer games provides an ideal opportunity to re-engage many disengaged young men in learning.Ultimately it seems likely that the way forward is to develop a range of games for learning which are competitive or not and which include social interaction or not and to guide students in selecting games which are most congruent with their own individual preferences. As with any other educational intervention, games for learning will need to be evaluated to ensure that they help learning and that they do so in a way that as far as possible does not favour one group over another.},

abstract = {This paper has two main aims. Firstly to conceptualize the production networks of the video games industry through an examination of its evolution into a multi-million dollar industry. Secondly, to use the video games industry to demonstrate the utility of Global Production Network approaches to understanding the geographically uneven impacts of globalization processes. In particular, three key notions of value, power and embeddedness are used to reveal the most powerful actors in the production network, how they maintain and exercise their power, and how the organization of production is manipulated as a result. It is argued that while hardware production is organized by console manufacturers using truly global sourcing strategies, the production of software is far more complex. In fact, software production networks are bounded within three major economic regions, Western Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. This paper seeks to explain how and why this has occurred.},

Yet, high lags frequently affect MMOGs, annoying customers. This frustrating phenomenon is mainly due to the best-effort service provided by the Internet that is often responsible for congestion and loss of responsiveness. To address this challenging issue, we consider a mirrored game server architecture and present a mechanism aimed at accelerating the delivery of game events generated during game sessions. Our approach rests upon the use of an optimistic synchronization mechanism that exploits the semantics of the game to diminish the delivery time of game events, whilst maintaining the full consistency of the game state. Experimental results are reported confirming the adequacy of our approach.},

They then met a similar dog character in a new embodiment (e g., as a stuffed animal if first met the dog as video character). Would children spontaneously generalize the facts they learned about the dog character across mediums (dynamic and static environments)? Results indicate that younger children were more likely to generalize facts across mediums. Specific aspects of the level of technology and interactivity had little effect.},

This allows building modular applications that provide information-rich services to the general public through a coherent and homogeneous multimedia HCI, that can be learned with low mental workload. On the other hand, MADE hides the low-level aspects of multimedia and service management, allowing designers to focus on the modalities of presentation of information and on user interaction.

Changes in physical activity behavior and aerobic capacity were used to assess effectiveness. Two informational interventions ("point-of-decision" prompts to encourage stair use and community-wide campaigns) were effective, as were three behavioral and social interventions (school-based physical education, social support in community settings, and individually-adapted health behavior change) and one environmental and policy intervention (creation of or enhanced access to places for physical activity combined with informational outreach activities). Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation are provided for these interventions. Evidence is insufficient to assess a number of interventions: classroom- based health education focused on information provision, and family-based social support (because of inconsistent findings); mass media campaigns and college-based health education and physical education (because of an insufficient number of studies); and classroom-based health education focused on reducing television viewing and video game playing (because of insufficient evidence of an increase in physical activity).

The framework significantly reduces RL computational complexity by decomposing the state space in a hierarchical manner.

We consider three typical profiles of RTS game players and compare two basic RL techniques applied in the game.

Within these games, it demonstrates how the diverse ethnic and religious identities of the Islamic world have been flattened out and reconstructed into a series of social typologies operating within a broader framework of terrorism and hostility. It then contrasts these broader trends in western digital representation with selected video games produced in the Arab world, whose authors have knowingly subverted and refashioned these stereotypes in two unique and quite different fashions. In conclusion, it considers the significance of western attempts to transcend simplified patterns of representation that have dominated the video game industry by offering what are known as \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}serious\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} games.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess developmental trends in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in British adolescents in relation to sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES).Design: A 5-year longitudinal study of a diverse cohort of students aged 11 - 12 years at baseline in 1999.Setting: 36 London schools sampled using a stratified random sampling procedure.Participants: A total of 5863 students categorised as white, black or Asian, and stratified for SES using the Townsend Index.Main outcome measures: Number of days per week of vigorous activity leading to sweating and breathing hard. Hours of sedentary behaviour, including watching television and playing video games. Data were analysed using multilevel, linear, mixed models.Results: Marked reductions in physical activity and increases in sedentary behaviour were noticed between ages 11 - 12 and 15 - 16 years. Boys were more active than girls, and the decline in physical activity was greater in girls (46\% reduction) than in boys (23\%). Asian students were less active than whites, and this was also true of black girls but not boys. Black students were more sedentary than white students. Levels of sedentary behaviour were greater in respondents from lower SES. Most differences between ethnic and SES groups were present at age 11 years, and did not evolve over the teenage years.Conclusions: Physical activity declines and sedentary behaviour becomes more common during adolescence. Ethnic and SES differences are observed in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in British youth that anticipate adult variations in adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk. These are largely established by age 11 - 12 years, so reversing these patterns requires earlier intervention.

abstract = {The motor control of 49 unmedicated boys clinically diagnosed with ADHD, case-matched with 49 non-ADHD boys, was assessed while playing Crash Bandicoot I, a Sony(TM) Playstation platform computer video game. In Crash Bandicoot participants control the movements of a small-animated figure through a hazardous jungle environment. Operationally defined measures of motor control were designated by (1) the stage of the game completed (ie, the number of obstacles successfully passed) before losing the figure\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}life\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, (2) the level of complexity that the stage represented and (3) the time taken to get to that point during the video game play. These measures were assessed under contrasting conditions of low or high working memory and distracter loads. Four tasks were administered (totalling 12 trials), incorporating both with and without distracter conditions. For those trials with the distracter, a segment of the television show The Simpsons was simultaneously played on a television screen adjacent to the computer game monitor. A 5-way MANOVA revealed that ADHD boys took less time to complete their trials under the direct condition (ie, no working memory load) on Crash Bandicoot, compared to their matched non-ADHD peers. When the task required additional working memory, however, the ADHD boys took significantly longer. Cumulative frequency plots of game performance revealed that in terms of the number of obstacles completed, the control participants successfully navigated more obstacles on the low working memory load task than the ADHD participants, but that the performance of the two groups was less distinguishable on the high working memory load task. The findings have implications for assessment and management of children with ADHD.},

abstract = {Console based video games are an increasingly familiar and engaging technology in the living room and as such, warrant critical attention. Considerations of their impact on the home have been widely regarded by new media academics as technological innovation and by social scientists as symptomatic of a decline in social and familial connectedness. In an attempt to move the debate beyond discussions of machine functionality and social crisis, this paper argues for a reframing of some of the ways we think about the impact of entertainment technologies on the home. It presents the notion of the digital hearth as a concept that shows how cultural meanings associated with the home can be transformed through gaming and changing patterns of consumption. The research examines the domestication of the console through cultural histories of the living room, the social context of electronic media, and ethnographic studies. It argues that the concept of the digital hearth represents a re-organization of the spaces in which collective engagement occurs and a shifting of the cultural norms associated with that collective engagement. In these spaces not only does the living room become the site of collective engagement but also the form of that engagement changes with the digital hearth acting as the focal point around social interaction. The paper traces parallels between the appropriation of television and of radio into the home and the domestication of the console while arguing that the console represents a shifting of spatial and social norms of domestication from previous electronic media. In addition it represents gaming in the home as symptomatic of changes from public to private forms of entertainment which constitutes a changing geographic base for social networks.

abstract = {Here, we demonstrate that action video game play enhances subjects\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} ability in two tasks thought to indicate the number of items that can be apprehended. Using an enumeration task, in which participants have to determine the number of quickly flashed squares, accuracy measures showed a near ceiling performance for low numerosities and a sharp drop in performance once a critical number of squares was reached. Importantly, this critical number was higher by about two items in video game players (VGPs) than in non-video game players (NVGPs). A following control study indicated that this improvement was not due to an enhanced ability to instantly apprehend the numerosity of the display, a process known as subitizing, but rather due to an enhancement in the slower more serial process of counting. To confirm that video game play facilitates the processing of multiple objects at once, we compared VGPs and NVGPs on the multiple object tracking task (MOT), which requires the allocation of attention to several items over time. VGPs were able to successfully track approximately two more items than NVGPs. Furthermore, NVGPs trained on an action video game established the causal effect of game playing in the enhanced performance on the two tasks. Together, these studies confirm the view that playing action video games enhances the number of objects that can be apprehended and suggest that this enhancement is mediated by changes in visual short-term memory skills.},

This work is based on various qualitative studies of games and players, and it will also be followed by qualitative and in-depth studies of various player groups. The need for such research is related on societal and media changes: digital media, particularly the Internet and games are often claimed to be among the key arenas of information society. At the same time, in popular discussion and in media, digital games and game players are often depicted in simplistic terms, and most often they remain just framed within the debates of harmful media effects and game violence.

abstract = {Cellular automata were designed by John von Neumann in the 1940s, as a mathematical abstraction for modeling self-replicating algorithms. Since then, cellular automata have been widely studied theoretically and evolved into multiple variants. In the 1970s, Bernard P. Zeigler proposed a formalism rooted on systems theory principles, named DEVS (discrete-event systems specifications), which paved the way for component-based modeling and simulation and related methodologies. The purpose of this article is to survey how cellular automata and its variant, called cell-DEVS, may be used to implement computer simulations that can be used as digital serious games. The authors illustrate that implementation through some of the practical applications of such cellular automata. They show various serious game applications using real case studies: first, a simple bouncing ball and pinball game, a particle collision model, another on gossip propagation, and an application on human behavior at a metro station.Then, they show an application to social simulation using a voters game, a theoretical application (a model called Daisy World, which is derived from Gaia theory), and applications to physical phenomena such as a sandpile formation model or, finally, a three-dimensional model of a \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}virtual clay\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} that changes its shape when it is subject to pressure effects. },

abstract = {Virtual worlds are enabling experiences that were not previously available through other media. One such experience is the potential to have a sense of inhabiting the simulated spaces they offer, not just through the use of the player’s imaginative faculty, but also through the cybernetic circuit between player and machine. This phenomenon has been described by the terms “presence” and “immersion”. Although the two terms are used in various fields and have been discussed for three decades, there seems to be a lack of consensus as to what either of them actually refers to (Ermi and Mayra, 2005; King and Krzywinska, 2006; Tamborini and Skalski, 2006; Brown and Cairns, 2004; Jennett et al., 2008). Of the two terms, immersion is particularly awkward because it has also been applied to the experiences of non-ergodic media such as painting (Grau, 2003), literature (Nell, 1988), and cinema (Bazin, 1967), all of which provide qualitatively different forms of engagement than game environments. Nevertheless the phenomenon these two terms try to describe is crucial to our understanding of the relationship between user and virtual world, as it represents one end of a continuum of intensity of involvement with virtual worlds and addresses the very notion of being in the context of such simulated environments. In this paper I claim that the confusion and apprehension surrounding the use of these two terms is based on a number of challenges they pose to a clear understanding of the phenomenon they have been employed to describe. The paper takes digital games as the most popular and experientially powerful forms of virtual worlds and thus uses them as its primary exemplar. The radical stance taken here will be to claim that this confusion arises because neither metaphor adequately describes the relationship between player and game. Both assume a uni-directional dive of human subjectivity into a containing vessel; a split between the physical “here” and the virtual “there” that is overcome temporarily when the phenomenon is experienced. I will further argue for a more precise and conceptually productive approach views the virtual world assimilated into the user’s consciousness as a space that affords the exertion of agency and expression of sociality in a manner coextensive with our everyday reality. The metaphors of presence and immersion are therefore replaced with the notion of incorporation: an experiential phenomenon that accounts for the simultaneous assimilation into consciousness of the virtual world and the systemic acknowledgement of the player’s location and existence therein. This turns the concept of a uni-directional plunge into the virtual on its head, and instead posits the virtual as a productive aspect of contemporary reality which is having a profound impact on notions of identity and sociality exactly because of this increasingly more seamless integration of simulated worlds and globally connected minds.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Performance of laparoscopic surgery requires adequate hand-eye coordination. Video games are an effective way to judge one\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s hand-eye coordination, and practicing these games may improve one\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s skills. Our goal was to see if there is a correlation between skill in video games and skill in laparoscopy. Also, we hoped to demonstrate that practicing video games can improve one\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s laparoscopic skills. Subjects and Methods: Eleven medical students (nine male, two female) volunteered to participate. On day 1, each student played three commercially available video games (Top Spin, XSN Sports; Project Gotham Racing 2, Bizarre Creations; and Amped 2, XSN Sports) for 30 minutes on an X-box (Microsoft, Seattle, WA) and was judged both objectively and subjectively. Next, the students performed four laparoscopic tasks (object transfer, tracing a figure-of-eight, suture placement, and knot-tying) in a swine model and were assessed for time to complete the task, number of errors committed, and hand-eye coordination. The students were then randomized to control (group A) or "training" (i.e., video game practicing; group B) arms. Two weeks later, all students repeated the laparoscopic skills laboratory and were reassessed. Results: Spearman correlation coefficients demonstrated a significant relation between many of the parameters, particularly time to complete each task and hand-eye coordination at the different games. There was a weaker association between video game performance and both laparoscopic errors committed and hand-eye coordination. Group B subjects did not improve significantly over those in group A in any measure (P >0.05 for all). Conclusion: Video game aptitude appears to predict the level of laparoscopic skill in the novice surgeon. In this study, practicing video games did not improve one\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s laparoscopic skill significantly, but a larger study with more practice time could prove games to be helpful.},

abstract = {The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) provides many great features, such as sufficient addressing space, mobility, and security; MIPv6 is one of the most important protocols for next generation mobile Internet. Simultaneously, with the rapid improvement of wireless technologies, the real-time multi-media IP services such as video on demand, videoconference, interactive games, IP telephony and video IP phone will be delivered in the near future. Thus, to furnish accurate QoS for real-time services is one of the most important thing in the next generation mobile Internet. Although RSVP, which is a resource reservation protocol, processes signaling messages to establish QoS paths between senders and receivers, RSVP was originally designed for stationary networks and not aware of the mobility of MNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel RSVP extension to support real-time services in Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) environments. For intra-site mobility, the concept of QoS Agent (QA) is proposed to handle the RSVP QoS update messages and provide the advanced reservation models for real-time services. For inter-site mobility, IP multicast can help to invite inter-site QAs to make pre-reservation and minimize the service disruption caused by re-routing the data path during handover. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme over HMIPv6 is more suitable for real-time services than the famous RSVP tunnel-based solution.},

Results indicated that frequency of play was not significantly related to body mass index or grade point average. However, there was a significant positive correlation between frequency of play and self-reported frequency of playing when bored, lonely, or stressed. As opposed to the general conception of electronic gaming as detrimental to functioning, the results suggest that gaming among college-aged men may provide a healthy source of socialization, relaxation, and coping.},

Computer games have been considered \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}a series of interesting choices\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} . Is it possible to think of games as moral objects? Or, more precisely: is the design of computer games morally accountable? Computer game design is the craft of gameplay, the challenge of creating a balanced and enjoyable game. In a way, computer game design is the art of creating interesting, entertaining choices. What are the ethics this activity imprints in computer games? What are the ethics of game design? This paper will argue for the analysis of computer games as moral objects because of the ethical values that can be imprinted in their design. Understanding the importance of design as a creative ethical activity, will allow the analysis of computer games\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} rethorics and the ways they are or could be used for conveying engaging ethical experiences. Understanding the morality of the digital expression can show us both the ways for new expressions, and the moral being of computer game as a form of art.},

However, a major drawback has been that ray tracing requires access to the entire scene data base. This is particularly problematic for hardware implementations that only have a limited amount of dedicated on-board memory. In this paper we propose a virtual memory architecture for ray tracing that efficiently renders scenes many times larger than the available on-board memory. Instead of wasting large dedicated memory on a graphics card, scene data is stored in main memory, and on-board memory is used only as a cache. We show that typical scenes from computer games only require less than 8 MB of cache memory while 64 NIB are sufficient even for scenes with GBs of geometry and textures. The caching approach also minimizes the bandwidth between the graphics subsystem and the host such that even a standard PCI connection is sufficient.},

The game is based on an inside plant virtual supply chain simulation and copes with the educational challenges of teaching Industrial Logistics in a new, effective way. By applying a visual interactive simulation package, the game creates a virtual dynamic scenario directly visible by participants, with an improvement of experimentation and conceptualisation phases, and offers several logistic decisions and their strategic links from a holistic point of view. The challenge goes beyond a pure theoretical setting and students learn strategies and gain experience directly by operating in a virtual supply chain and sharing knowledge. The Logistic Game has been used to train more then 300 students since December 2006 in three different Italian workshops and has been designed to encourage the employment selection process by the companies involved.},

While in the early age of computer games the design of space primarily caused specific interpretations and acts (invasion or defence of space \{$\backslash$textendash\} as a matter of opinion), the latter concepts become more and more indefinite: Former hard-fought dungeons and space stations resolve into landscapes open for relational perspectives. Insofar as the design of space loses its impact on the perceptions and actions of the players, acts of social communication and not warfare reduce uncertainty. The thesis is that this process gives rise to the formation of communities and the unpredictable configuration of space.

Accordingly, this paper develops a simulation environment in which students can create a game strategy via programming for a challenging strategy-type game. After completion of the game, the environment provides the student with a set of metrics that provides helpful clues as to how the student might reprogram the strategy to improve the result. The provided metrics help to avoid a tedious trial-and-error refinement process and, therefore, greatly motivate the student to complete the assignment and achieve a better result. The simulation environment can be used in either a standalone mode or in an interactive mode in which the students compete against one another online. The competition element increases the motivation of the students to complete the task to the best of their ability.},

Games shape player behaviour by presenting goals which players attempt to fulfil.
This is the most common \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}folk\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} theory of the relationship between game design and player behaviour. It is also one central to most game design literature and to much work within the game studies field.
</p>
<p>
In this dissertation, the simple idea that players try to win is explicated through a \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}Rational Player Model\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\}, a tool for understanding the relationship between game goals and the behaviour of players who try to reach these goals. The model is discussed and applied in two capacities:
</p>
<p>
A) As a model for formal analysis which can used to understand and categorize certain aspects of games related to goals. Here, video games are studied through the lens of (economic) game theory in order to determine, for instance, the types of conflict dynamics the games will elicit given Rational Player assumptions.
</p>
<p>
B) As an ideal type of actual player behaviour. Here, the model is used to derive concrete predictions about video game player behaviour which are then compared to actual play in an empirical study of multiplayer console gaming. The dissertation finds that the Rational Player Model is one of four models of player behaviour common in the game studies/design literature and that it is the predominant model within game design. Also, the model is found to often operate at so deep a level as to be unstated. Applying the model analytically, video games are
categorized as competitive, semicooperative or cooperative and it is shown how the number of players influence a game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s conflict dynamics. This leads to an analysis of \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}strategicness\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} of different game types; a combined measure of the degree to which other players matter to the choices of the \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}rational\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} player and the range of these choices.
</p>
<p>
Finally, deriving behavioural predictions from the model and comparing these to data from a study on multiplayer console play, players are found to behave \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}rationally\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} within the gamespace itself while working to fulfil various social functions in their verbal interaction.

An ordinary table-top display (cathode ray tube; CRT) and a near-eye display (NED) suitable for mobile gaming are compared in two different driving games. A measurement model based on a large dataset (n=2182) is applied to study psychological aspects of the game adaptation. This model integrates two constructs considered important for the game adaptation: involvement and presence. The results show that the content affected the subjective sense of presence. However, the form did not have an effect on the presence. These results indicate that NED\&\#39;s are capable of supporting similar adaptation to the game worlds as compared to CRT\&\#39;s. However, the results also weakly indicate that playing with a CRT increases the evaluations of interaction. The study shows the advantages of using multidimensional measures in studying a rich human-computer interaction.

Behavior is a complex process influenced by multiple factors, often making it difficult to change. Behavioral science provides insight into factors that influence specific actions that can be used to guide key game design decisions. This article reports how behavioral science guided the design of a serious video game to prevent Type 2 diabetes and obesity among youth, two health problems increasing in prevalence. It demonstrates how video game designers and behavioral scientists can combine their unique talents to create a highly focused serious video game that entertains while promoting behavior change.},

The instructionists, accustomed to thinking in terms of making instructional educational materials, turn naturally to the concept of designing instructional games. Far fewer people have sought to turn the tables: by making games for learning instead of playing games for learning. Rather than embedding "lessons" directly in games, constructionists have focused their efforts on providing students with greater opportunities to construct their own games--and to construct new relationships with knowledge in the process. Research has only begun to build a body of experience that willmake us believe in the value of playing and making games for learning.},

abstract = {For a long time, computer games were limited to input and output devices such as mouse, joystick, typewriter keyboard, and TV screen. This has changed dramatically with the advent of inexpensive and versatile sensors, actuators, and visual and acoustic Output devices. Modem games employ a wide variety of interface technology, which is bound to broaden even further. This creates a new task for game designers. They have to choose the right option, possibly combining several technologies to let one technology compensate for the deficiencies of the other or to achieve more immersion through new modes of interaction. To facilitate this endeavor, this chapter gives an overview on current and upcoming human-computer interface technologies, describes their inner workings, highlights applications in commercial games and game research, and points out promising new directions.},

abstract = {Research on videogames has largely focused on their negative effects on aggressive attitudes and behaviours (e.g., Anderson \& Bushman, 2001; Anderson et al., 2004). However, the motivations and experiences associated with this activity have received little theoretical and empirical attention. These aspects of gaming were examined in a sample of regular gamers using a mixed-methods approach. An online questionnaire was completed by a sample of gamers (N=310). This included an open-response section which asked participants to provide an account of their intrinsic and extrinsic gaming motivations, and associated experiences. Analyses of the qualitative data revealed that the main motivations for gaming were the need for socialisation, challenge, accomplishment, fantasy, stress-relief, alleviation of boredom, escapism and exploration. Enjoyment and flow were also important experiential factors, consistent with previous research findings. The analysis of the quantitative data suggested the influence of achievement and immersion-orientated motivations on flow experiences. The qualitative aspect of the study also provided a more detailed exploration of the motivations for videogame use, and offers some indication of the relationship between gaming motivations and enjoyment. Future research should further utilise qualitative methodologies to provide a more detailed examination of gaming experiences and associated outcomes.},

In this study, we argue that in some cases, use of trait, rather than state, aggression can serve to attenuate effects. We report the results of a study in which a trait aggression scale is reworded slightly to create a state measure. The state and trait scales are then compared in high- and low-aggression priming conditions. Results suggest that though both scales are reliable and both have construct validity, the reworded state aggression scale responds more to the high prime than to the low prime. More important, it also responds more than the original trait scale does. Therefore, minor variations in studies of media\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s effect on aggression, such as variations in scale wording, can serve to attenuate effects.},

Transcripts of gathered video tape reveal how student \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}gamer talk\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} became increasingly implicit, using terminology provided by the game and their shared context of playing the game. Over time, communication among game player group members generally became more efficient and less penetrable by members outside the group (such as new players), as players engaged in culture-building activities around their shared context. However, players occasionally became more explicit in their communication when grounding was required to reach shared meaning, such as in instances where players disagreed on the purpose of a particular game feature or strategy. Finally, implications are offered to suggest ways in which gamer cultures can be made more accessible to game designers and those guiding classroom interactions.},

The conceptual schema for this research was the uses-and-gratifications perspective. The males in the sample played video games at twice the weekly average of the females, were consistently stronger in all measured motives than the females, and preferred physically oriented video games over the females\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} preference for more traditional, thoughtful games. Younger players opted for the fantasy motive in their playing and older players more so for competition. Preference for physical games declined among the older males, and generally motives were stronger in the middle years of playing for both males and females than in the youngest and oldest age groups.

abstract = {Predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence is one of the most important current problems of modern biology. The GASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) blind prediction experiments aim to assess the prediction capabilities in the field. A limitation of GASP is that predictions are prepared and filed by humans using programs, and thus, what is being evaluated is the performance of the predicting groups rather than the performance of the programs themselves. To address this limitation the Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction (CAFASP) experiment was initiated in 1998. In CAFASP, the participants are programs or Internet servers, and what is evaluated are their automatic results without allowing any human intervention. In this paper, we review in brief the current state of protein structure prediction and describe what has been learned from the CAFASP1 experiment, the evolution toward CAFASP2, and how we foresee the future of automated structure prediction. We observe that the histories of "in silico" structure prediction experiments and computer chess tournaments show some striking similarities as well as some differences. We question whether the major advances in automated protein structure prediction stem from novel insights of the protein folding problem, of protein evolution and function, or merely from the technical advances in the ways the evolutionary information available in the biological databases is exploited We conclude with a speculation about the future, where interesting chess might only be observed in computer games and where the interpretation of the information encoded in the human genome may be achieved mainly through in silico biology.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine what kind of violence-related behavior or opinion is directly related to excessive media use among adolescents in Switzerland. Methods: A national representative sample of 4222 schoolchildren (7th- and 8th-graders; mean age 13.9 years) answered questions on the frequency of television-viewing, electronic game-playing, feeling unsafe at school, bullying others, hitting others, and fighting with others, as part of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) international collaborative study protocol. The Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to high-risk groups of adolescents. Results: For the total sample, all bivariate relationships between television-viewing/electronic game-playing and each violence-related variable are significant. In the multivariate comparison, physical violence among boys ceases to be significant. For girls, only television-viewing is linked to indirect violence. Against the hypothesis, females\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} electronic game-playing only had a bearing on hitting others. Conclusions: Experimental designs are needed that take into account gender, different forms of media, and violence to answer the question of whether excessive media use leads to violent behavior. With the exception of excessive electronic game-playing among girls, this study found that electronic media are not thought to lead directly to real-life violence but to hostility and indirect violence. },

In general, the user prescribes a sequence of motions one by one while providing an input trajectory.

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven scheme for transforming a user-prescribed trajectory to a human trajectory in an on-line manner. As preprocessing, we analyze example motion data to extract human steering behavior. At run-time, the input trajectory is refined to reflect the steering behavior. Together with an existing on-line motion synthesis system, our scheme forms a feedback loop, in which the user effectively specifies an intended human trajectory.},

so-called "finger-twitch" games, often maligned by academics, are both complex and
significant for cultural studies. While the game structure of binary combat is most often
seen in terms of simple entertainment, lacking narrative power and encouraging an apathetic
and passive attitude to violence, the author argues that games such as Mortal
Kombat, Street Fighter, and Soul Calibur are complex in terms of their construction of
stereotyped identity and in the binary structure of combative play. Further, the significance
of the genre lies in the performative aspects of gameplay, which problematize
accepted models of identification and immersion. Once the player is introduced into the
superficial binary structure of combat, then that player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s choice and agency become the
primary factors in gameplay, ultimately creating space for the inversion of stereotype,
the subversion of gender roles and the possible transcendence of the binary system},

Electronic Art\&\#39;s Majestic game was released in July 2001 and quickly generated media buzz with its unusual multi-modal gameplay. Mixing phone calls, faxes, instant messaging, real and \&quot;fake\&\#39; websites, and email, the game provides a fascinating case of an attempt at new directions for gaming communities. Through story, mode of playing, and use of technology, Majestic highlights the uncertain status of knowledge, community and self in a digital age; at the same time, it allows examination of alternative ways of understanding games\&\#39; role and purpose in the larger culture. Drawing on intricate storylines involving government conspiracies, techno-bio warfare, murder and global terror, players were asked to solve mysteries in the hopes of preventing a devastating future of domination. Because the game drew in both actual and Majestic-owned/-designed websites, it constantly pushed those playing the game right to borders where simulation collides with \&quot; factuality\&\#39;. Given the wide variety of \&quot;legitimate\&\#39; conspiracy theory, alien encounters and alternative science web pages, users often could not distinguish when they were leaving the game\&\#39;s pages and venturing into \&quot; real\&\#39; World Wide Web sites. Its further use of AOL\&\#39;s instant messenger system, in which gamers spoke not only to bots but to other players, pushed users to evaluate constantly both the status of those they were talking to and the information being provided. Additionally, the game required players to occupy unfamiliar subject positions, ones where agency was attenuated, and which subsequently generated a multi-layered sense of unease among players. This mix of authentic and staged information in conjunction with technologically mediated roles highlights what are often seen as phenomenon endemic to the Internet itself; that is, the destabilization of categories of knowing, relating, and being.

To determine the patterns of computer usage among adolescents in Hong Kong and to examine whether computer usage is associated with less physical activity and social support among adolescents. Methods: A total of 2110 secondary school students (52\% boys and 48\% girls) in Hong Kong completed a set of questionnaires to measure their computer usage and lifestyle. Mean age of the respondents was 14.16 years (SD = 1.81 years). Computer usage was taped by asking the students to indicate how much time (in minutes) they spent on the computer each day for doing homework assignments; playing computer games; "surfing" the Internet; and communicating with others. The students also provided information on their social-physical lifestyle. Student\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s t-tests and analysis of variance were used to examine group differences. Pearson product moment correlations were used to explore relationships between computer usage and lifestyle. Results: Boys who use computers for doing homework, "surfing" the Internet, and communicating with others engage in more social-physical activities than others. Boys who use computers to play games tend to be more social-behaviorally inactive. For girls, patterns of computer usage are not related to lifestyle. Conclusions: Computer users tended to engage in social-physical activities more frequently and had higher social support than nonusers. But among computer users, the amount of time spent daily on the computer was not associated with lifestyle. Instead, patterns of computer usage are more related to lifestyle and the relationship is moderated by gender.},

abstract = {<p>
Scientific culture is not popular because the essential nature of science - the models and practices that make it up - cannot be communicated via conventional media in a manner that is interesting to the average person. These models and practices might be communicated in an interesting manner using the new medium of the digital game, yet very few digital games based upon scientific simulations have been created and thus the potential of such games to facilitate scientific knowledge construction cannot be studied directly. Scientific simulations have, however, been much used by scientists to facilitate their own knowledge construction, and equally, both simulations and games have been used by science educators to facilitate knowledge construction on the part of their students. The large academic literatures relating to these simulations and games collectively demonstrate that their ability to re-create reality, model complex systems, be visual and interactive, engage the user in the practise of science, and to engage the user in construction and collaboration, makes them powerful tools for facilitating scientific knowledge construction. Moreover, the large non-academic literature discussing the nature of digital games (which are themselves both simulations and games) demonstrates that their ability to perform the above tasks (i.e. to re-create reality, model complex systems, and so forth) is what makes them enjoyable to play. Because the features of scientific and educational simulations and games that facilitate knowledge construction are the very same features that make digital games enjoyable to play, the player of a scientific-simulation-based digital game would be simultaneously gaining enjoyment and acquiring scientific knowledge. If science were widely communicated using digital games, therefore, then it would be possible for there to be a popular scientific culture.

For power gamers, technology and gender are most highly integrated. These women enjoy multiple pleasures from the gaming experience, including mastery of game-based skills and competition. Moderate gamers play games in order to cope with their real lives. These women reported taking pleasure in controlling the gaming environment, or alternately that games provide a needed distraction from the pressures of their daily lives. Finally, the non-gamers who participated in the study expressed strong criticisms about game-playing and gaming culture. For these women, games are a waste of time, a limited commodity better spent on other activities.

We conclude that product placement within computer games is an effective means of fostering high spontaneous brand recall and even of influencing consumers less positively predisposed towards a brand (analogous to non-users).These findings have promising managerial implications for firms looking to grow their customer base through acquisition and conversion.},

Customer Service Representatives require interfaces that provide them with knowledge about the customer, products and services and company procedures in a way that is fast, easy to digest and easy to use. However, usability and efficiency have proved to be insufficient for such tools to be used in an operational environment. This study shows how the redesign of a knowledge system for a contact centre using designs inspired by computer games can be used to address issues of usage and acceptance. Two new designs were produced; one for use whilst online with the customer, emphasising the need for efficiency, speed and usability of knowledge access and another for use whilst offline which was more about having fun, knowledge sharing, personalisation and exploring the knowledge space.},

A number of recent trends suggest that there is a potential for unmistakable entertainment in the operation of a number of contemporary surveillance practices that merit further empirical and theoretical study. The paper discusses several examples that are illustrative of these trends, such as computer games and artistic presentations. Although this analysis does not downplay the problematic and negative features of current surveillance practices, it aims to accentuate some of the ways in which surveillance-enabling technologies are able to perform entertainment functions.},

In Study 1, the authors found that the frequency of playing racing games was positively associated with competitive driving, obtrusive driving, and car accidents; a negative association with cautious driving was observed. To determine cause and effect, in Study 2, the authors manipulated whether participants played I of 3 racing games or I of 3 neutral games. Participants who played a racing game subsequently reported a higher accessibility of cognitions and affect positively associated with risk taking than did participants who played a neutral game. Finally, on a more behavioral level, in Study 3, the authors found that men who played a racing game subsequently took higher risks in computer-simulated critical road traffic situations than did men who played a neutral game. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Many graphics applications, including computer games and 3D animated films, make heavy use of deforming mesh sequences. In this paper, we generalize gradient domain editing to deforming mesh sequences. Our framework is keyframe based. Given sparse and irregularly distributed constraints at unevenly spaced keyframes, our solution first adjusts the meshes at the keyframes to satisfy these constraints, and then smoothly propagate the constraints and deformations at keyframes to the whole sequence to generate new deforming mesh sequence. To achieve convenient keyframe editing, we have developed an efficient alternating least-squares method. It harnesses the power of subspace deformation and two-pass linear methods to achieve high-quality deformations. We have also developed an effective algorithm to define boundary conditions for all frames using handle trajectory editing. Our deforming mesh editing framework has been successfully applied to a number of editing scenarios with increasing complexity, including footprint editing, path editing, temporal filtering, handle-based deformation mixing, and spacetime morphing.

abstract = {This paper presents an information-driven sensor management problem, referred to as treasure hunt, which is relevant to mobile-sensor applications such as mine hunting, monitoring, and surveillance. The objective is to infer a hidden variable or treasure by selecting a sequence of measurements associated with multiple fixed targets distributed in the sensor workspace. The workspace is represented by a connectivity graph, where each node represents a possible sensor deployment, and the arcs represent possible sensor movements. An additive conditional entropy reduction function is presented to efficiently compute the expected benefit of a measurement sequence over time. Then, the optimal treasure hunt strategy is determined by a novel label-correcting algorithm operating on the connectivity graph. The methodology is illustrated through the board game of CLUE (R), which is shown to be a benchmark example of the treasure hunt problem. The game results show that a computer player implementing the strategies developed in this paper outperforms players implementing Bayesian networks, Q-learning, or constraint satisfaction, as well as human players.},

The same subset was also observed crossing roads. Older children switched faster and were less distracted. Children who were better at switching were more likely to show awareness of traffic when about to cross a road. Children who maintained concentration when challenged by a distracting event crossed the road in a less reckless manner.

Video games and digital worlds are promising new modes of association capable of connecting people in a way that passive forms of mass communication are unable to. This essay shows the strength of video games as a medium for associational life by turning to the thought of one of the preeminent philosophers of collective action: Alexis de Tocqueville. Although Tocqueville lived long before the advent of video games, his theory of democracy provides an excellent account of the benefits of civic associations. Among these are teaching enlightened self-interest, creating feelings of efficacy, protecting individuality, and establishing meritocratic norms. Video games are capable of providing each of these goods, making them an effective supplement, though not a replacement, to traditional associational life in an age of increasing fragmentation.},

They were asked what the main character will do, say, think, and feel as the story continues. People who played a violent video game described the main character as behaving more aggressively, thinking more aggressive thoughts, and feeling more angry than did people who played a nonviolent video game.

This experimental study investigated to what degree, if at all, video game interactivity would help or hinder the noticing and recall of second language vocabulary. Eighty randomly-selected Japanese university undergraduates were paired based on similar English language and game proficiencies. One subject played an English-language music video game for 20 minutes while the paired subject watched the game simultaneously on another monitor. Following gameplay, a vocabulary recall test, a cognitive load measure, an experience questionnaire, and a two-week delayed vocabulary recall test were administered. Results were analyzed using paired samples t-tests and various analyses of variance. Both the players and the watchers of the video game recalled vocabulary from the game, but the players recalled significantly less vocabulary than the watchers. This seems to be a result of the extraneous cognitive load induced by the interactivity of the game; the players perceived the game and its language to be significantly more difficult than the watchers did. Players also reported difficulty simultaneously attending to gameplay and vocabulary. Both players and watchers forgot significant amounts of vocabulary over the course of the study. We relate these findings to theories and studies of vocabulary acquisition and video game-based language learning, and then suggest implications for language teaching and learning with interactive multimedia.},

abstract = {One of the major goals in the development of virtual environments in recent years has been to create more and more realistic scenery, characters and natural human forms of interaction with the environment. We question this approach especially for the domain of computer games for two main reasons. Firstly we argue the following: When the absolute difference between reality and virtual environments decreases one would expect the latter to become increasingly believable for a spectator. Paradoxically often the opposite is true since the attention of the spectator gets drawn to the remaining differences to a greater extent. Secondly we ask ourselves why of all things computer games which are created for entertainment should be limited with real world constraints and are not used to experience features that are only possible in virtual environments. We conclude with a \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}manifesto\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} for the renovation of computer games.},

abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to present the different issues that must be tackled when creating a viable multi-user, multi-device game. The issues tackled range from user interaction issues to graphics quality to bandwidth constraints. The paper also aims to present different configurations depending on the type of game to be created and a strategy for network gaming using heterogeneous devices focusing on the development of a game that allows users of mobile devices and desktop computers to interact and compete on a single domain. Design/methodology/approach - A tank battle game was developed that plays the same game across both a mobile device such as a phone/PDA and a desktop counterpart. Findings - Although there is a sacrifice in the richness of the game environment on mobile devices, it is possible to develop games that play across platforms and devices, and safeguards can be put in place in order not to overly handicap players using mobile devices. Research limitations/implications - The research focused on a single type of game. It would be ideal to attempt such work on other game genres or platforms. The implications of such work would be that the ubiquity of game play could be extended and the overall gaming experience improved. Originality/value - This paper allows game developers to rethink the possibilities as they develop new games.},

Since the launch of Pong in the 1970s, computer and videogames have grown into a 30 billion worldwide industry. Between 2000 and 2004 the UK\&\#39;s consumption of videogame products and activities grew by over \{$\backslash$textsterling\}15 billion, with the recent successful UK and US launches of Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sonyj Playstation Portable (PSP) not yet included in those figures. In recent years there has been an upsurge in the number of researchers stdyinggaming. Topics have inclzlded investigations of the reasons why people play videogames, the potential of games in educational settings, and the efects which these games, and the culture which surround them, may be having on society. As videogame phying becomes more widespread and increasing numbers of videogame playing students enter higher education, educational research into the impact of extensive videogame playing on student approaches to learning and attitudes toward higher education is vital. The chapter begins by presenting an introduction to the culture of videogames and continues with a discussion on the relevant literature in this research area. An overview of our research project currently being carried out in the School of Education at the University of Edinburgh in the UK will be provided. The project is seeking to explore the experience of videogame play among students in higher education, and to identify the differences which might exist between gamers and non-gamers in their approaches to learning and study, and in their attitudes toward higher education. Finally, key results of our project will be presented and discussed in the context of current research.

During the ensuing discussions dominance in the shape of disgust or contempt made up 18 \% of all facial expressions. Different types of smiles, however, were far more frequent - they made up almost half of all facial expressions. Hierarchical regression analyses which were guided by a theoretical model suggest that children showed more often expressions of anger and denigration on their faces when they considered themselves to be rejected by their peers, when their relation ship with their play partner was overshadowed by competition (girls only), and when they experienced intense anger and contempt at the same time. Implications of dominance and denigration for the partner and the cooperation as well as the need of furthering the development of emotional competence are discussed.},

A realistic human-like architecture is expected in a thematic computer game, since it strongly motivates the game players in an intuitive way. However, the task of building a human-like architecture is non-trivial since the construction is a real time process without human supervision. In this paper, we present a collective building algorithm inspired by social insects for intelligent construction based on multiple agents. A swarm of virtual agents indirectly design edifications, which resemble basic features in human-like architecture by using a stigmergic mechanism along with branching rules. The main idea of the algorithm is to map sensory information to appropriate building actions.

These games are often casual, two-dimensional games and do not utilise the specialist graphics hardware which has proliferated across modern PCs and Consoles. Multiuser online game play in these titles is often either non-existent or extremely limited. Computer games applications which grace the current generation of consoles and personal computers are designed to utilise the increasingly impressive hardware power at their disposal. However, these are commonly distributed using a physical medium or deployed through Custom, proprietary networking mechanisms and rely upon platform-specific networking APIs to facilitate multi-user online game play.

abstract = {A recent trend in ubiquitous computing is the development of new forms of interfaces, which rely on embodied interaction. We focus on the definition of embodiment that refers to the ways in which abstract concepts rely on metaphorical extensions of embodied schemata shaped by processes below the level of conscious awareness as explored by Lakoff and Johnson [Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., 1980. Metaphors We Live By. Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, USA]. Our inquiry focuses on understanding the role embodied metaphors may play in supporting people to understand the possibilities for physical interaction in augmented spaces. We explore this issue through the development and evaluation of an interactive audio environ- ment. We instantiate metaphor theory by using embodied schemata as the basis for the interactional metaphor that relates full-body input actions to audio output responses. We demonstrate and explore the benefits of this approach through a comparative experiment in which adults and children learn to use our audio environment. The results from our experiment indicated that embodied metaphors improve usability however, other factors including discoverability, perceivability of feedback and duplic- ity of structural isomorphism may mediate these metaphor-based benefits. We have generalized our main findings as a set of suggestions for the design of embodied style interfaces that rely on physical interaction.},

abstract = {Georg Simmel [American Journal of Sociology 55:254-261 (1949)] is widely credited as the first scholar to have seriously examined sociability - "the sheer pleasure of the company of others" and the central ingredient in many social forms of recreation and play. Later Ray Oldenburg [The Great Good Place. New York: Marlowe \& Company (1989)] extended Simmel's work by focusing on a certain class of public settings, or "third places," in which sociability tends to occur, such as, bars, coffee shops, general stores, etc. But while Simmel and Oldenburg describe activities and public spaces in the physical world, their concepts may apply as well to virtual or online worlds. Today Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are extensive, persistent online 3D environments that are populated by hundreds of thousands of players at any given moment. The sociable nature of these online spaces is often used to explain their success: unlike previous video games, MMOGs require players to exchange information and collaborate in real-time to progress in the game. In order to shed light on this issue, we critically examine player-to-player interactions in a popular MMOG (Star Wars Galaxies). Based on several months of ethnographic observations and computerized data collection, we use Oldenburg's notion of "third places" to evaluate whether or not the social spaces of this virtual world fit existing definitions of sociable environments. We discuss the role online games can play in the formation and maintenance of social capital, what they can teach us about the evolution of sociability in an increasingly digitally connected social world, and what could be done to make such games better social spaces.},

abstract = {The increasingly popularity of videogames suggests the need to examine the derived experiences and potential outcomes of gaming. Furthermore because gaming is becoming increasingly social, it is important to understand the influence of social gaming experiences for affective and psychological outcomes. The current research examined the associations between social motivations and gaming experiences and aimed to explore the associations of these factors with the outcomes for mood and life satisfaction. The programme of research consisted of two studies of different methodologies in which videogamers (N = 327) took part. Results showed that there were significant correlations between social motivations, social gaming contexts and the positive experiences derived through gaming. Also social motivations showed to be predictive of perceptions of life satisfaction. Qualitative analysis revealed the importance of social connectedness and belonging for game enjoyment and suggested these social factors to be key features which keep gamers playing. Social interactions and networking in gameplay were also influential to game enjoyment. Findings revealed, however, that social experiences could influence feelings of frustration in gameplay. This showed to arise from bad social dynamics and competitiveness against other players. The current research findings therefore show the importance of social experiences and their influences on the outcomes of gaming. Future research is needed to examine the role of competiveness on social dynamics in gaming and its influence on gaming effects. Furthermore, research examining the differences between gaming experiences for online and offline contexts, for both solo and multiplayer gaming is warranted. },

Results were that brief exposure to a violent video game increased aggressive behavior. Mediational analyses suggested that the violent video game effect on aggression was not mediated by instrumental aggressive motivation, but was partially mediated by revenge motivation. Other results suggested that the violent video game effect on aggression might be greater when the game player controls a same-sex violent game character. },

abstract = {This thesis contributes to the field of Game Studies by presenting the hypothesis that the player(s) and soundscape(s) in the first-person shooter (FPS) game, and the relationships between them, may be construed as an acoustic ecology. It explores the idea that the single-player FPS game acoustic ecology has the basic components of player and soundscape and that the relationships between these two lead to the creation and perception of a variety of spaces within the game world constituting a significant contributing factor to player immersion in that world. Additionally, in a multiplayer FPS game, these individual acoustic ecologies form part of a larger acoustic ecology which may be explained through autopoietic principles.

There has been little written on digital game sound (much less on FPS game sound) and so the research contained within this thesis is an important contribution to the Game Studies field. Furthermore, the elaboration of the hypothesis provides insight into the role of sound in the perception of a variety of spaces in the FPS game, and player immersion in those spaces, and this has significance not only for Game Studies but also for other disciplines such as virtual environment design and the study of real-world acoustic ecologies.

A text-based methodology is employed in which literature from a range of disciplines is researched for concepts relevant to the hypothesis but, where necessary, new concepts will be devised. The aim of the methodology is to construct a conceptual framework which is used to explicate the hypothesis and which may, with future refinement, be used for the study of sound in digital game genres other than FPS.},

A sample of 27 children was randomly assigned to (1) a home group instructed to play the IDSVG at home; (2) a multiplayer group instructed to play the IDSVG at home and to participate in a weekly IDSVG multiplayer class. Participants were asked to play the IDSVG as often as they liked and report the playing time daily on a calendar for a 12-week period. Motivation to play was assessed by the playing duration of IDSVG in minutes and the dropout during the study. Mean age of the 16 children who completed the study was 10.6 $\backslash$pm0.8 years. During the 12-week intervention period, the multiplayer group played approximately twice as many minutes (901 min) as the home group (376 min, p = 0.13). Dropout was significantly (p = 0.02) lower in the multiplayer group (15\%) than in the home group (64\%).

Multiple methods have been used to help maintain neck immobility after grafting. It has been challenging to maintain strict bedrest protocols, because of decreased compliance and boredom. To address this issue, we examined common sedentary diversional activities engaged in by children. We decided to use video games to facilitate the intrinsic motivation of play. The monitor of a video game activity was inverted and placed behind the head of the bed so that the child could maintain proper neck positioning. We found the activity to be beneficial in many aspects. It helped maintain neck positioning, decreased the demand for individual interventions, and provided opportunities for improving self-confidence.},

abstract = {Digital games are a relatively new medium. While they have been around for over half a century, they only became a major part of the culture relatively late. Like every other medium before, games also have struggled to find an expressive language of their own. Some of the expressive styles of other media are still relevant for games, but new ones have to be created specifically for videogames. This dissertation is a study of how ludonarrative videogames, videogames that combine game elements with narrative elements, express and convey meaning. This is done as part of game studies, a multidisciplinary approach to studying games. The purpose is twofold: to build a foundation for better under- standing of meaning-making in games, and to provide game designers with tools for analyzing issues related to meaning. This study uses philosophical tools to analyze meaning in games. The philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer is used to compare the meaning-making in games to the interpretation of works of art. The theory of the interpretive process is based on the idea of the hermeneutic circle. Wittgen- stein’s concept of language-games is used in examining how games should be defined and how their relations to each other should be understood. These philosophical methods are combined with the study of procedurality, narrativi- ty and players. This study shows that ludonarrative games are procedural systems that are interpreted both during gameplay and as a part of the surrounding cultural context. The result of this interpretation is neither predetermined by the game designer nor fixed during gameplay, but potentially open for endless reinter- pretation as players interact with the game in new ways and as the cultural con- text changes. In order to convey meaning, ludonarrative games can borrow ex- pressive tools from other media, for example by using perspective in the way it is used in cinema. Additionally, this study provides guidelines for designing meaning. It is shown how meaning can be used as a game mechanic, and how games contain unique ways of expressing things that would be hard to convey in other media.},

abstract = {Firms in durable good product markets face incentives to intertemporally price discriminate, by setting high initial prices to sell to consumers with the highest willingness to pay, and cutting prices thereafter to appeal to those with lower willingness to pay. A critical determinant of the profitability of such pricing policies is the extent to which consumers anticipate future price declines, and delay purchases. We develop a framework to investigate empirically the optimal pricing over time of a firm selling a durable-good product to such strategic consumers. Prices in our model are equilibrium outcomes of a game played between forward-looking consumers who strategically delay purchases to avail of lower prices in the future, and a forward-looking firm that takes this consumer behavior into account in formulating its optimal pricing policy. The model incorporates first, a method to infer estimates of demand under dynamic consumer behavior, and second, an algorithm to compute the optimal sequence of prices given these demand estimates. The model is solved using numerical dynamic programming techniques. We present an empirical application to the market for video-games in the US. The results indicate that consumer forward-looking behavior has a significant effect on optimal pricing and profits of games in the industry. Simulations reveal that the profit losses of ignoring forward-looking behavior by consumers are large and conomically significant, and suggest that market research that provides information regarding the extent of discounting by consumers is valuable to video-game firms.},

Results from 49 children (aged 5 yrs) indicate there was no significant difference in computer use by sex or age, but there was a significant difference in the frequency of computer use by classroom in the 2nd half of the project compared to the 1st half. There was no significant difference in the software selected. Results suggest that it is important for schools not only to buy computer hardware, but that schools also need to provide an educational consultant who knows technology and young children to help teachers get started using computers in the classroom.},

abstract = {Every Day the Same Dream is a short art game created by the radical game designers Molleindustria, formed and fronted by the Italian artist Paolo Pedercini. The game was produced in 2009 and has since garnered praise within and without the gamer community. This essay pursues a sustained close reading and playing of the game with the goal of providing an interpretation of its complex political meanings. During the exegesis of the game I explore new, interpretive forms of analysis that have arisen around the video game medium (i.e. Espen Aarseth's notion of simulational hermeneutics and Alexander Galloway's concept of gamic allegory). I argue that these forms tend to privilege the understanding of game mechanics and player actions over visual and narrative representations in a game. While these new hermeneutical methods are undeniably useful for uncovering the significance of a particular video game I show how they can be used to marginalize and eclipse interpretive methods focused on gamic representations, thus potentially truncating a game's overall significance or "message." This essay demonstrates that Every Day the Same Dream's political meanings cannot be exhausted by focusing exclusively on game mechanics or player actions, and that a critic needs to pay close attention to the entirety of a game's meaningful modalities—including visual and narrative representation—in order to understand the totality of a game's significance. In the end, while I engage with recent theories of interpretation within game studies, the core of the essay pursues a viable, political reading of Molleindustria's haunting, remarkable dream.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to simulate protective behaviors in response to tire ways a human may fall to the ground as Well as incorporate tire reactive motions into motion capture animation. It is based on simulated trajectory prediction and biomechanics inspired adjustment. According to the external perturbations, our system predicts a motion trajectory and uses it to select a desired transition-to sequence. At tire same time, physically generated falling motions will fill ill the gap between tire two-motion capture sequences before and after the transition. Utilizing a parallel simulation, our method is able to predict a character\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s motion trajectory real-time under dynamics, Which ensures that the character moves towards the target sequence and makes the character\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s behavior, more life-like. Our controller is designed to generate physically plausible motion-following all upcoming motion with adjustment from biomechanics rules, Which is key to avoid air unconscious look for a character during the transition. Based on a relatively small motion database, our system is effective in generating various interactive falling behaviors. },

In this paper, we analyze and design control system of soccer robot in the frame of visual servoing. We think that our approach encourages more systematic approaches to soccer robot system. MIROSOT system is a typical direct visual servo system with a fixed camera and mobile robots with internal sensors such as encoders. In real games, encoders often offer wrong position data due to slips and collisions between robots or between a robot and a walt However, vision provides positions and orientations of robots in certain accuracy regardless of slips or collisions. In spite of this advantage inevitable time-delay arising from vision and communication subsystems seriously causes undesired effects in control of robots. In this paper we present a visual servo controller considering the time-delay. First, we present an accurate dynamic model of organic cooperation of robot soccer systems [3] that includes the time-delay. And we design the Smith predictor [13] using the model to cancel out the deteriorating effect of time-delay in our soccer robot system And using the model, we also propose control structure with primary/secondary controller [12] to control the system precisely. Finally, we show performance of the proposed controller and the predictor in simulation studies.},

Videogames become laboratories for social experimentation where the scenarios, conditions and situations affecting a given human phenomenon are reproduced. In this article, 35 videogames are analysed to find out which contents can be approached through them for the teaching of Social Sciences using problem-solving strategies. To this end, instruments for information gathering (data collection grid) and analysis (category system) were designed. The different contents of a social nature are analysed according to the study categories and in turn from the areas of social issues detected in them. We present a working proposal for the use of videogames in the classroom on the basis of resolution of relevant problems, determining which are the issues that we consider relevant, what questions the pupils can be asked to approach through videogames and what the characteristics, benefits and obstacles are in the use of these resources in the teaching of Social Sciences.},

abstract = {Associations between a preference for violent electronic games and adolescents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} self-perceptions of problem behaviors and emotions were examined. It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a standardized self- report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty-two 11- through 15-year-olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale (P < .01) and YSR Total Score (P < .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing (P < .06) and Anxious-Depressed (P < .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to rind the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. },

Changes in anxiety and aggression produced by aggressive computer games were found to depend on the initial level of aggression of the subjects. In adolescents with a high baseline level of aggression, the amplitude of the N200 component increased in the frontal and decreased in the temporal areas of the cortex, whereas, in adolescents with a low baseline aggression level, N200 decreased in the frontal and increased in the temporal cortical areas. },

abstract = {Multimedia technology has played an important role in modern computing because it offers more natural and user-friendly interactions with an automated system. This is particularly true for systems utilizing graphical, icon or window-based input and output. Multimedia technology also facilitates "reuse" more naturally, since the basic components and functions of presentation and animation can be reused for several different animation scenarios. This is evidenced by the rapid prototyping capability of computer and video games where although the characters and story lines change, the basic animation remains constant. In this paper we utilize multimedia technology for eliciting requirements of software systems, particularly those systems that utilize windows- (or graphical)-based interactions with the user. Our methodology will implicitly emphasize reuse since in our approach reusable components include not only code and documents, but also voice narration, animation sequences and message mechanisms. We call such software components as multimedia reusable components (MRCs). Using MRCs. one can view software requirements instead of reading textual representation of the requirements. },

abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between the perceived strangeness of a virtual character and the perception of human likeness for some attributes of motion and sound. Participants (N=100) were asked to rate thirteen video clips of twelve different virtual characters and one human. The results indicate that attributes of motion and sound do exaggerate the uncanny phenomenon and how frightening that character is perceived to be. Strong correlations were identified for the perceived strangeness of a character with how human-like a character\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s voice sounded, how human-like the facial expression appeared and how synchronized the character\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s sound was with lip movement; characters rated as the least synchronized were perceived to be the most frightening. Based on the results of this study, this article seeks to define an initial set of hypotheses for the fear-evoking aspects of character facial rendering and vocalization in survival horror games that can be used by game designers seeking to increase the fear factor in the genre, and that will form the basis of further experiments, which, it is hoped, will lead to a conceptual framework for the uncanny.},

I will argue why in game research the current use of the term magic circle is problematic. We can understand the term differently when returning to the context in which Huizinga introduced the magic circle as ritual play-ground. According to him ritual is play and play is ritual. Referring back to his work Homo Ludens (1938) I will discuss the various relationships between role-play and ritual performance. I will argue that fantasy role-playing consists of collections of performances or ritual acts, in which players construct the game/play space, identities and meaning.},

Given the increase in screen media targeted at the very young, the purpose of this study was to examine preschooler parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} knowledge about expert recommendations for young children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s screen media experience, their knowledge of specific screen media ratings, their beliefs about screen media effects, and actual monitoring practices.METHOD. Parents of 94 children < 5 years of age (mean age: 2.95 years) were surveyed. Questionnaires were distributed in day care centers and completed at the parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} convenience. The questionnaire included background questions about parental education, age and gender of child, and parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} perceptions of their child\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s favorite television show and favorite video or computer game. Eleven multiple-choice questions assessed the respondent\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s knowledge of expert recommendations for screen media for preschoolers and the meaning of television and video game content ratings. Fourteen questions addressed the typical amount of their preschooler\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s screen media exposure, parental rules regarding screen media use, and parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} beliefs about appropriate use of screen media for preschoolers.RESULTS. Preschoolers were exposed to an average of similar to 12 hours of screen media in a typical week. Parents believe that media do have either short- or long-term effects on preschoolers. Performance on factual questions was poor (mean score: 2.83 of 11). In particular, only 34\% of the parents correctly identified the expert recommendation for children > 2 years of age.CONCLUSIONS. Parents should continue to be educated about the need for preschoolers to participate in activities that promote language development, socialization, imagination, and physical activity. Although professionals should work to improve the ratings, and ultimately to implement a universal ratings system for all screen media, parents need to be encouraged to improve their understanding of current recommendations for screen media exposure and television and video game ratings.

Beyond the aesthetic, this metaphor may also increase the player’s sensitivity to broader informatic or protocological control outside of the game world, a concept Alexander Galloway develops from Gilles Deleuze’s Societies of Control. The embodied metaphor attaches a kinetic materiality to the abstractions of contemporary informatic organization, making them, at least momentarily, concrete and tangible.},

This game is categorised as a first-person shooter (FPS), and is a multiplayer networked game. Differences between this game and other first-person shooters such as Quake III include the realism that Counter Strike achieves and the immersive qualities that surround that player. Different experiments were completed; group one, the control group, where the participants were tested three times without playing computer games between tests and group two where they were only tested twice, but played Counter Strike for two hours before the second test. This group showed a statistically significant improvement in their multitasking abilities.

We investigated preventive health behaviors (bicycle helmet, seat belt, and sunscreen use), physical activity, television viewing or video game playing, and nutrition (fruit, vegetable, milk, and soda consumption) among Asian and Latino adolescents living in the United States; assessed trends across generations (first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants or later); and compared each generation with White adolescents. Methods. We used data from 5801 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in the representative 2001 California Health Interview Survey. Results. In multivariate analysis, first-generation Asians measured worse than Whites for preventive health behaviors (lower participation), physical activity (less activity), and television viewing or video game playing (more hours), but improved across generations. For these same behaviors, Latinos were similar to or worse than Whites, and generally showed no improvement across generations. First-generation Asians and Latinos had healthier diets than. Whites (higher fruit and vegetable consumption, lower soda consumption). With succeeding generations, Asians\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} fruit, vegetable, and soda consumption remained stable, but Latinos\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} fruit and vegetable consumption decreased and their soda consumption increased, so that by the third generation Latinos\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} nutrition was poorer than Whites\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}.

And perhaps most importantly, computer games represent a new mode of aesthetic as well as social discourse, an alternative to the narrative, which has been the leading paradigm until now: the primary means to convey knowledge and experience. Now, however, the mode of simulation is sued as an effective pedagogical tool that privileges active experimentation with its subject material rather than observation. Simulation is also a way to explore the partly unknown, to test models and hypotheses, and thus to construct and acquire new knowledge in a way narrative never could. The article at hand defends the claim that spatiality is a central theme in computer games. It starts by expanding this claim: Spatiality is the defining element in computer games. They are essentially concerned with spatial representation and negotiation, and therefore a classification of computer games can be based on how they represent space.},

Focusing on First-Person Shooters (FPS), we argue that player(s) and soundscape(s), and the relationships between them, may be usefully construed and conceptualized as an acoustic ecology. An argument is presented that, even though its sonic palette may be smaller, the FPS acoustic ecology emulates real world ecologies as players form a vital component in its construction and maintenance. The process of building a conceptual framework for understanding and testing the function of game sound as an acoustic ecology is broadly outlined, involving the application and extension of a disparate range of media sound theories in addition to the construction of new concepts to account for the unique features of the interactive medium of FPS games.},

abstract = {Video game was the first truly digital entertainment medium, requiring processing power both in the production and consumption stage. Born out of the transistor, it was also intimately connected with its logic: the doubling of the processor capacity every 18th month or the halving of the price for the same processing capacity in the same time. Transistor technology and video games have been able to conquer society in an evolutionary process. Hence, video games have had an unprecedented ability to conquer new platforms and incorporate new technologies. In this regard it is the foremost example that growth of a medium succeeds not by digital convergence but digital divergence (1). What started out on a mainframe has later moved to the arcade, the home console, handhelds, the personal computer, and the mobile phone. The development of new platforms has made gaming experience possible trough a more diversified market that incorporate a larger part of our life (work, home, travel time, leisure time) and economic segments. Today, games are available on five different platforms (2), in some cases these different platforms have been non-competitive in the sense that they have complemented each other (such as the handheld and the console), in other cases they have been competitive to a large degree (e.g. the console and the PC). The game mediums\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} unique ability to utilize and adapt to different platform makes it metaphorical to its nature. For every gaming platform, games have developed its own expression and the platform diversification in itself has also been one of the reasons behind the long term viability and growth of the game industry; when one platform for various reasons has stagnated, another platform has been able to continue to innovate. The development of hardware has also changed the nature of games and gamers from a socio-cultural point of view. When the main gaming market moved from the arcade to the home console market, adventures with developed characters became possible. When the CD-ROM was introduced to the console market with Playstation and Sega Saturn, the ability to incorporate music, video and high quality pictures made lifestyle oriented games possible that could follow different cultural trends. The evolution of communication technology made different kind of online games possible, making games a social experience. The move from the arcade to the home meant, from a sociological point of view, that the group of players became more diverse. People who previously would or could not play computer games due to the fact that the games were placed in public meeting places mostly dominated by young males, could now enter the game worlds from home: elderly people, children, and women. Recent surveys of Massively Multi-Player Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) (3) show, for example, that the average age of players is unexpectedly high, and that a comparatively large fraction of the players are women. The domestication of computer games also led to a higher degree of social complexity in- and outside the games. In addition to the interaction with players in the game the home backdrop allows interaction with family members and friends physically present. The use of home communication technologies for gaming purposes increases the interaction complexity further. The result is a multi-faceted and simultaneous on- and offline interaction process. Object Our paper explores how the shifts and diversification of video game platforms have affected both the industry, as well as its socioeconomic context. We argue that the technological development in primarily processing capacity and later on storage capacity and communication technologies profoundly has changed the comparative advantages of different business model over the history of video games. The nature of this transformation can explain the shift in industrial leadership for companies producing hardware, as well as the outcomes of the battle between firms from different industries competing for this leadership. The paper will study the hardware and industry system in three major periods, the Atari era, the Nintendo era and the Sony era. Each period has had its own market logic and the shift has been unexpected but fast, regardless of the strong position held by the dominant firm. As digital technology has transformed boundaries between industries, firms from many earlier separated industries have entered the game hardware market. Repeatedly, the disruptive nature of technology has changed the competitive marketplace. Industrial leaders have been unable to change when the technological development has transformed the competitive advantages of different business models. To a large degree, the situation resembles what has been described as \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}the innovator\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s dilemma\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} (4). We argue that the proliferation of platforms have been essential to the evolution of the video game industry. When one platform stagnated, new forms of software could evolve in entirely unexpected places. The multitude of platforms made it possible to overcome tendencies of stagnation. It has also made it harder for dominant actors to monopolize or control the market. Technology has always found a way to slip through. The recent emergence of on-line gaming has increased the room for innovation in several unexpected ways. Indeed, it has added a new dimension to gaming. As communities evolve around games an interactive social context is added. The effects of Metcalfe\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s law are added to Moore\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s law, and a vast expanse of innovative possibilities is created. The new social context of gaming might call for a very different kind of entrepreneurial capabilities. (1) Jenkins, H. (2001) \{$\backslash$textquotedblright\}Convergence?

abstract = {The 1970 proposition that there is an Uncanny Valley which man-made characters inhabit as their human-likeness (both appearance and movement) increases has been a growing topic of debate in the fields of robotics, animation and computer games particularly since the turn of the century. However, what the theory and subsequent related writings do not account for is the role of sound in creating perceptions of uncanniness and fear, a particularly useful attribute in computer game genres such as survival horror. This paper has a dual purpose: to explore diverse writings on the uncanny as they relate to sound and to prepare the groundwork for future work investigating the possible relationship between sound and the Uncanny Valley.

The paper comprises, in large part, a survey of selected works on the uncanny and the Uncanny Valley from a variety of disciplines. It emphasizes the link between uncanniness and negative emotions, such as fear and apprehension, and discusses the genesis of the term uncanny in early psychoanalytical writings, relating this to more modern theories on human emotion. Writings on the uncanny, or related emotional states, from psychoacoustics, textiles research, films and computer games are assessed as to their validity and potential application to the fostering of an aural climate of fear in computer games and, where such writings do not explicitly deal with sound, attempts are made to apply the ideas contained within to sound as it exists within computer games. In dealing with the theory of the Uncanny Valley, the paper points out the theory\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s focus on appearance and movement to the exclusion of sound and suggests that there is an uncanny in sound that might, in future, be used to modify the Uncanny Valley theory. Throughout, there is the suggestion that the uncanny (and any future theory of an audio or audiovisual Uncanny Valley) can be harnassed to the design of horror computer games.

Ultimately, it is hoped, such work will be of use to computer game sound designers who wish to create a greater perception of fear and apprehension through the canny use of uncanny sound. Some of the design tips presented at the end of the discussion are already used instinctively by sound designers across a range of media, including computer games, whereas others are less obvious in their origin and affect. Recently published empirical data is provided to strengthen the case for the latter. In some cases, the design tips must await the coming of procedural audio to computer games.},

abstract = {21st Century Game Design is not just a book about game design. It\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s an answer to two important questions: who are we designing games for and how do we do it best? Written by industry pros, the book teaches designers how to design better games from a why perspective. All good designers know the fundamentals of how to design a game, but learning to design games that really satisfy your players takes more than technical skill. To do this successfully, you need to know your intended audience and understand their needs. Throughout the book you\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}ll learn about defining and investigating player needs. A model of play styles is then presented that was developed by applying psychological metrics to survey data and case studies. This model identifi es some of the core themes in player needs as represented by four player types-- Conqueror, Manager, Wanderer, and Participant. In addition to discussing player needs, the book also explores how games can reach wider audiences by appealing to the interests of the core gaming community, and it considers the fundamental principles of game design. Methods such as interface design, structural elements, and game world abstractions are discussed in relation to the needs of the audience. The book does not attempt to present an absolute view of the craft of game design, but rather it demonstrates how an audience model can inform the design process and take the games industry forward at a time when it is facing a schism between the games that the audience would like to play, and the games the development community would like to make. Game designers, producers, marketing executives, and anyone who wishes to understand the relationship between a game and its audience will find much to learn from 21st Century Game Design.},

The main argument is that the genre being used is \&quot;real life\&\#39;. The game\&\#39;s creators are assuming the players share with them, and with each other, an understanding of real life, which can be transposed into the game world. The article explores this notion of a real-life narrative that is shared, by considering the ways in which family and other relationships are both conceptualized and played out in the game. Whilst real life as genre is problematized here, the tensions and conflicts of contemporary real-world conceptualizations of family and other relationships do appear to be represented in the game. What is interesting then, given this, are the ways in which players negotiate the gameplay. The article concludes by suggesting that players are active agents negotiating both the game\&\#39; s version of real life, and their own real-world experiences.

abstract = {Today millions of players interact with one another in online games, especially massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). These games promote interaction among players by offering interdependency features, but to date few studies have asked what interdependency design factors of MMORPGs make them fun for players, produce experiences of flow, or enhance player performance. In this study, we focused on two game design features: task and reward interdependency. We conducted a controlled experiment that compared the interaction effects of low and high task-interdependency conditions and low and high reward-interdependency conditions on three dependent variables: fun, flow, and performance. We found that in a low task-interdependency condition, players had more fun, experienced higher levels of flow, and perceived better performance when a low reward-interdependency condition also obtained. In contrast, in a high task-interdependency condition, all of these measures were higher when a high reward-interdependency condition also obtained.

abstract = {A computer role-playing game for language learning was created in a European project. The process was challenging with a multidisciplinary team from three countries who did not know each other well before the project started. Game designers, linguists, pedagogues and teachers have different approaches to how such an educational tool should function. The requirements for the game were scarce before the project started, so it was up to the team to agree on the game design and contents. We early realised that we had to work much more closely together than what is common in educational projects, so we used virtual meeting rooms extensively in addition to many physical meetings. One important conclusion regarding the process is that small prototypes should have been made very early to enhance the understanding and cooperation between the writers and designers and those responsible for the pedagogical contents. Designers and pedagogical personnel should also have had a much closer cooperation in the early phases to better integrate the learning material into the game story. This paper discusses how we worked together to get consensus about the game. We will also touch upon some of the technical difficulties we had trying to satisfy all our requirements with the chosen open source platforms. We also say a few words about the first reactions of the target group. The focus is however on the process of making educational games and what can be learnt from this experience.},

abstract = {Purpose: Physical fitness and physical activity cracking data enhance our understanding as to when children settle into their long-term exercise and fitness patterns and, therefore, provide insight as to when programs focusing on preventing sedentary adults behaviors should be initiated. Methods: In this paper, the tracking of physical fitness and physical activity was examined in a 5-yr population-based study of children and adolescents in Muscatine, IA. Study subjects (N = 126) were pre- or early-pubescent at baseline (mean age boys 10.8 yr and girls 10.3 yr). Physical fitness was measured using direct determination of oxygen uptake and maximal voluntary isometric contraction while physical activity was assessed via questionnaire. Results: Boys classified as sedentary based on initial measurements of TV viewing and video game playing were 2.2 times more likely than their peers to also be classified as sedentary at follow-up. Tracking of most physical fitness and physical activity variables was moderate to high, indicating some predictability of early measurements for later values. Sedentary behavior tracked better in boys, whereas vigorous activity tended to track better in girls. Conclusion: These observations suggest that preventive efforts focused on maintaining physical fitness and physical activity through puberty will have favorable health benefits in later years.},

Sixty-six children aged 5-12 years old completed questionnaires assessing video game experience and preferences and empathy and attitudes toward violence. The children played a violent or nonviolent video game and then responded to vignettes about everyday occurrences. Vignette responses were coded for aggression and empathy. Preexisting empathy and attitudes towards violence were positively related to the corresponding vignette scores. Long-term exposure to violent video games contributed to lower empathy vignette scores. Playing a violent versus a nonviolent game did not affect vignette responses. Results suggest that long-term exposure to violent video games may be associated with desensitization as reflected in lower empathy, although the direction of causality remains unclear. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several cross-sectional studies reported that heavier children eat breakfast less often. However, no longitudinal studies have addressed whether skipping breakfast leads to excessive weight gain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether skipping breakfast was prospectively associated with changes in body fatness. METHODS: A cohort of 414 000 boys and girls from all over the US, 9- to 14-y-old in 1996, returned annual mailed questionnaires (1996 - 1999) for the Growing Up Today Study. We analyzed change in body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) over three 1-y periods among children who reported breakfast frequency. RESULTS: Children who reported that they never eat breakfast had lower energy intakes than those who eat breakfast nearly every day. Children who were more physically active reported higher energy intakes, as did those who reported more time watching television/ videos and playing videogames. Like previous studies, skipping breakfast was associated with overweight, cross-sectionally. However, overweight children who never ate breakfast lost BMI over the following year compared to overweight children who ate breakfast nearly every day (boys: - 0.66 kg/m(2) (s.e. = 0.22); girls: - 0.50 kg/m(2) (s.e. = 0.14)). But normal weight children who never ate breakfast gained weight relative to peers who ate breakfast nearly every day ( boys: + 0.21 kg/m(2) (s.e. = 0.13); girls: + 0.08 kg/m(2) (s. e. = 0.05)). Breakfast frequency was positively correlated with self-reported quality of schoolwork. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight children who never eat breakfast may lose body fat, but normal weight children do not. Since numerous studies link skipping breakfast to poorer academics, children should be encouraged to eat breakfast.},

We consider the problem of determining how much realism is required for a variety of applications. We discuss how current trends in computer graphics hardware, and in particular of graphics cards targeted at the computer games industry, will help or hinder achievement of these requirements. With images now being so convincingly realistic in many cases, critical faculties are often suspended and the images are accepted as correct and truthful although they may well be incorrect and sometimes misleading or untruthful. Display resolution has remained largely constant in spatial terms for the last twenty years and in terms of the number of pixels has increased by less than an order of magnitude.

The principle of indeterminacy applied to the social and human realm stipulates that the only way we can know human reality is by engaging it. Gaming represents a particularly powerful approach to engage people in shaping learning communities and in enhancing communities of practice. Principles and methods for designing gaming/simulations as such are well documented in the literature. In the 1970s and 1980s the communities of gamers have paid special attention to the methods and techniques of game design and model building. For example the proceedings of the annual international conferences of the International Simulation And Gaming Association (ISAGA) of 1979 focuses on \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}How to build a simulation/game\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} (Bruin, K. et al. 1979). It is out of the scope of this special issue to discuss in detail the specifications of simulation/game design or to assess particular design methods. Focus is on the ramifications of simulation/game design and its impact on the broader social context of use. Simulation/game design does not happen in a social vacuum. It is part of a common understanding of associations such as ISAGA, NASAGA, SAGSET, ABSEL, JASAG, and SAGSAGA, which propagate proper design and use of simulation games, the debriefing included. It is also embedded in the practice on how to involve the user or client system in the design process. Moreover, gamers aim at influencing social practice by improving the competencies of individual actors and social agents involved.<br />

At the same time, the strong form of the embodied cognition hypothesis is at variance with currently available neuropsychological evidence. We suggest a middle ground between the embodied and disembodied cognition hypotheses--grounding by interaction. This hypothesis combines the view that concepts are, at some level, 'abstract' and 'symbolic', with the idea that sensory and motor information may 'instantiate' online conceptual processing.},

In particular, the paper asks whether the abstract domain of time gets its relational structure from the more concrete domain of space. Relational similarities between space and time are outlined along with several explanations of how these similarities may have arisen. Three experiments designed to distinguish between these explanations are described. The results indicate that (1) the domains of space and time do share conceptual structure, (2) spatial relational information is just as useful for thinking about time as temporal information, and (3) with frequent use, mappings between space and time come to be stored in the domain of time and so thinking about time does not necessarily require access to spatial schemas. These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence for Metaphoric Structuring. It appears that abstract domains such as time are indeed shaped by metaphorical mappings from more concrete and experiential domains such as space.},

abstract = {Background: Many children are reported to have insufficient physical activity (PA) placing them at greater risk of poor health outcomes. Participating in sedentary activities such as playing electronic games is widely believed to contribute to less PA. However there is no experimental evidence that playing electronic games reduces PA. There is also no evidence regarding the effect of different types of electronic games (traditional sedentary electronic games versus new active input electronic games) on PA. Further, there is a poor understanding about how characteristics of children may moderate the impact of electronic game access on PA and about what leisure activities are displaced when children play electronic games. Given that many children play electronic games, a better understanding of the effect of electronic game use on PA is critical to inform child health policy and intervention.Methods: This randomised and controlled trial will examine whether PA is decreased by access to electronic games and whether any effect is dependent on the type of game input or the child\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s characteristics. Children aged 10-12 years (N = 72, 36 females) will be recruited and randomised to a balanced ordering of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}no electronic games\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, \{$\backslash$textquoteright\} traditional\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} electronic games and \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}active\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} electronic games. Each child will participate in each condition for 8 weeks, and be assessed prior to participation and at the end of each condition. The primary outcome is PA, assessed by Actical accelerometers worn for 7 days on the wrist and hip.

The player uses 3 adaptation methods in order to support high efficiency when it plays MPEC-4 contents. The adaptation methods are composed of a physical adaptation, an event adaptation, and a resource adaptation. The first adaptation resolves the physical difference between the authoring environment and playback environment. The second adaptation resolves some events that cannot support on mobile devices. The last adaptation resolves the load for restricted resource on mobile device. In view of the results of the performance analysis on the player, we could find that the player showed an efficient playback of MPEC-4 contents on a mobile device. The applications for the player are as follows; mobile games, a car navigator, distance learning, etc.},

Yet, where the wishes of players diverge from those of game publishers, the legal and ethical interests of players remain unclear. The most applicable set of legal principles are those of copyright law, which is often grounded in utilitarian justifications, but which may also be justified on deontological grounds. Past copyright cases involving video arcade and per-sonal computer gaming suggest that the gaming scenaria generated by players may constitute original selec-tion and arrangement of the game elements, thus qualifying such gaming sequences for copyright protection as either derivative works or works of joint authorship. But this result may be difficult to justify on utilitarian theories. Rather, the personal investment of game players suggests a deontological basis for claims of game sequence ownership.},

abstract = {Whimsy describes the capricious, playful and fanciful, and designates something irrational or without an immediately obvious reason to exist. I argue that this frivolity and illogicality are precisely what can make whimsy a significant, if fleeting, ground for micro-political change. To demonstrate this claim I use the example of yarn bombing – a contemporary form of street art in which knitted and crocheted items are attached to parts of the urban landscape. Yarn bombing, I argue, does more than feminise the city, for the whimsy with which it is imbued has the capacity to increase our attentiveness to habitual worlds in a series of micro-political gestures. Yet it is impossible to fully recognise and harness a politics of whimsy, for doing so defies its character as frivolous and without motive, and supersedes these traits with intentionality and utility. As a result, a politics born of whimsy is always-already a paradoxical politics. The broader question thus becomes one of how to dwell in whimsy’s ungraspable moment in order that we might remain open to newpolitical and ethical potentialities.To explore these issues, this paper draws on performative ethnographic fieldwork, wherein 30 yarn bombs were made and displayed in the city of Bristol during 2011.},

We propose to give the possibility to the people to use the first and the third-person perspective like in video games (e.g. GTA). As the gamers prefer to use the third-person perspective for moving actions and the first-person view for the thin operations, we will verify this comportment is extendable to simulations in augmented and virtual reality.

abstract = {This paper is based on ongoing research into the gendered use of mobile convergent media in the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, what role does the cute have and how does it correlate with types of consumption? As a region, the Asia-Pacific is marked by diverse penetration rates, subject to local cultural and socio-economic nuances. Two defining locations - Seoul (South Korea) and Tokyo (Japan) - are seen as both mobile centres and gaming centres which the world looks towards as examples of the future-in-the-present. Unlike Japan, which pioneered the keitai (mobile) IT revolution with devices such as i-mode, South Korea has become a centre for mobile DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadband) with the successful implementation of TV mobile phones (TU mobile) in 2005. One of the key features of mobile media technologies is the attempt by the industry to find the next killer application . One such application is the possibility of online multiplayer games accessed through mobile (broadband) telephonic devices such as MMO golf RPG Shot Online (a golf game for mobile phones). Amongst this frenzy of trend spotting and stargazing, Seoul as a mobile broadband and gaming centre provides a curious case study for the social and cultural intricacies informing the rise of gaming as an everyday practice for many Koreans.
This article begins by outlining the game play and technoculture particular to South Korea and then explores the phenomenon of Kart Rider in South Korean gaming cultures - and its perception/ reception outside Korea - to sketch some of the issues at stake in playing it cute (particularly in the form of cute avatars), consuming Korea and the endurance of co-present communities. In particular, it contemplates the implications of current emerging online mobile gaming genres such as so-called female games such as the cute\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} Kart Rider in order to think about changing modes of game play and attendant social spaces.},

abstract = {This paper examines the web-based virtual marriage game craze that emerged in the 1990s. These online interactive games may have opened up moments of liberation and formulated new ideologies of sexual relations. However, web-based marriages only ensure a male-dominated system and conform to dominant patriarchal standards - regardless of the number of females involved. Re-enacting the rules of marriage, the cyber game is ideologically directed against free unions, mobility, promiscuity, and parafamilial fluidity - all in order to stabilize individuals for reasons of social and political control; at the same time, it promotes the acquisition of skills needed by individual players in a free market, as if paralleling the drastic re-articulation of the economy. I understand the virtual game to be a safe haven for both China and the Chinese people to imagine that they can re-strengthen and re-virilize themselves in a rapidly changing world. They co-fabricate a depthless interface or a pure semblance of a looming powerful China ruled by a male-oriented system. Just as China dreams of achieving modernity through a consistent, dependable, controlled, and \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}clean\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} path, the virtual reality of the marriage game reveals a social imaginary in which contemporary Chinese people picture their social existence in an unstable transitional moment.},

abstract = {In Gaming Matters, Judd Ethan Ruggill (Arizona State University) and Ken S. McAllister (University of Arizona) offer a playful and provocative look at the computer game medium, arguing that games are:
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Idiosyncratic, and thus difficult to apprehend using the traditional tools of media study;
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Irreconcilable, or complex to such a degree that developers, players, and scholars have contradictory ways of describing them;
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Boring, and therefore obligated to constantly make demands on players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} attention;
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Anachronistic, or built on age-old tropes and forms of play while ironically bound to the most advanced technologies;
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Duplicitous, or dependent on truth-telling rhetoric even when they are about fictions, fantasies, or lies;
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Work, or are often better understood as labor rather than play;
\{$\backslash$textbullet\} Alchemical, despite seeming all-too mechanical or predictable
In its assessments, Gaming Matters neither flatters game enthusiasts nor emboldens the medium\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s detractors. Instead, it provides a new set of lenses through which games can be examined, and in the process makes a significant contribution to the foundation of both computer game and new media studies.
Judd Ethan Ruggill (Arizona State University) and Ken S. McAllister (University of Arizona) co-direct the Learning Games Initiative (LGI), a transdisciplinary, inter-institutional research group that studies, teaches with, and builds computer games. They also curate one of the world\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s largest research-oriented computer game archives, and have written and lectured extensively on the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration, the politics of digital media, and the importance of play in scholarship.},

For people, relationships are created with the help of behaviour-shaping norms, which infants begin to discover and manipulate by the third month. To build relationships, machines can also learn to exploit human reactions in real-time decision-making. In the video game Tetris, for example, affect co-opts computer-generated patterns to simplify cognitive tasks: norms mediate what Kirsh and Maglio (Cognitive Sci., 18, pp. 513-549, 1994) term epistemic actions, which allow implicit knowledge to shape key pressing in ways that, given past games, are likely to be informative and valuable. Expert players act to change their cognitive states by allowing the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s higher-level states to constrain their lower-level actions. Since this process enables the development of expertise, we might expect it to be widespread; but it seems marginal in hamadryas baboons, although they use affect and complex norms. In humans, by contrast, infants use adults as cognitive resources in developing their epistemic abilities. This has engineering implications for android designers. Since androids can elicit epistemic actions, engineers need to develop an affect sensitive inter-face. If successful at this, even rudimentary co-action may prompt people to report experiencing androids as both making choices and violating expectations.},

The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with BPD also make use of dichotomous and schema-specific evaluations in noninterpersonal situations. An experiment was designed in which a frustrating and rewarding situation was induced by computer games that subjects had to play. Participants evaluated both themselves and the games. Patients with BPD (n = 24) were characterized by somewhat more extreme game evaluations in the emotionally negative situations than normal controls (n = 25), participants with a cluster C (n = 10) or an antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) (n = 16). Patients with BPD appeared to be characterized best by a general negative evaluative style, more than by DT or splitting. ASPD participants showed a positivity bias in both conditions.},

Following, a qualitative case study highlights the use of affordances, or potentials for action, during video game player interaction among peers and the game interface. Relationships among affordances and levels of activity are presented, which broaden the concept of affordances to include motivations. Additionally, activity theory will complement analysis by introducing the mediational triangle (Cole \& Engestr\{\"{o}\}m, 1993), providing a guide with which to analyze game player interactions and motives. The mediational triangle sheds light on the motivated activity itself, the tools available to complete the activity, and peer relationships (such as role specialization and rules of interaction) to evaluate game designs and their ability to fulfill serious purposes with meaningful outcomes.},

Indeed, heavier computer use was associated with significantly greater participation in cultural and other free time activities, even after multivariate adjustment.

In particular, we focus on broadcast encryption technology. The use of an open, standard-based architecture enables the development of a more restrictive protection system for games.

from its initial entertainment roots to a number of \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}serious\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} industries. Games are being

rapid growth in the power of game technologies and the growing social acceptance of
these technologies has created an environment in which these are displacing other
industry-specific computer hardware and software suites.
This paper puts forward a game impact theory that identifies five specific forces that
compel industries to adopt game technologies for their core products and services. These
five forces are computer hardware costs, game software power, social acceptance, other
industry successes, and native industry experimentation. Together these influence the
degree and rapidity at which game technologies are adopted in a number of industries.
This theory is meant to be useful to managers who must make decisions about adopting,

The current case study seeks to present a series of "classic" bishoujo videogames and explain how they function to orient the Western player to the culture of modern Japan through the phenomenon of telepresence. Aspects of telepresence that include transportation and immersion are considered toward the end of offering the player a degree of access to some aspects of modern Japanese culture. It is suggested that, by experiencing a sense of telepresence through inhabiting a Japanese avatar, the non-Japanese player has the potential to obtain a heightened level of competence in negotiating Japanese culture.},

abstract = {This paper addresses how intelligent characters, having learning capability based on the neural network technology, automatically adapt to environmental changes in computer games. Our adaptation solution includes an autonomous adaptation scheme and a cooperative adaptation scheme. With the autonomous adaptation scheme, each intelligent character steadily assesses changes of its game environment while taking into consideration recently earned scores, and initiates a new learning process when a change is detected. Intelligent characters may confront various opponents in many computer games. When each intelligent character has fought with just part of the opponents, the cooperative adaptation scheme, based on a genetic algorithm, creates new intelligent characters by composing their partial knowledge of the existing intelligent characters. The experimental results show that intelligent characters can properly accommodate to the changes with the proposed schemes.},

To illustrate the methodology, a case study from Chile is used where portable educational video games were introduced into first and second grade classrooms with the aim of improving learning in mathematics and language.

abstract = {The monitoring of children in time and space, from a distance via mobile phones, is a phenomenon never experienced in previous generations. Indeed, as frequently recited, the increased protection of children by monitoring them is a central characteristic of modern childhood (Rasmussen 2004; Qvortrup 1993) and the effects of this are not yet known. Equally, our understanding of how children in middle childhood (8 – 12 years) negotiate and or resist this monitoring is unclear. This paper seeks to add to the emerging body of knowledge from an anthropological perspective on the strategies employed by children in middle childhood to negotiate and resist the monitoring and surveillance of their physical selves in time and space using mobile phones predominantly. I suggest that the mobile phone can be transformed by children into a highly efficient device to enable them to both negotiate and resist surveillance thus increasing their autonomy and independent mobility. Children are not passive recipients of parental surveillance and power, rather they are increasingly playing an active role in negotiation with parents and actively resist monitoring of their everyday lives.},

They have been successfully applied to the Robocup, but never before used in computer games, We verify the quality of the action selection mechanism and its correctness in a series of experiments. Then we asses the performance of an agent using an EBN against a plain reactive agent with identical sensory-motor apparatus and against a totally different agent built around finite-state machines.

abstract = {During the last 30 years computer and videogames have grown into a large entertainment industry of economical as well as cultural and social importance.As a distinctive field of academic inquiry begins to evolve in the form of game studies, the majority of approaches can be identified as emerging either from a background of literary theory which motivates a concentration on narrative structures or from a dedicated focus on the rules in video and computer games. However, one of the most evident properties of those games is their shared participation in a variety of spatial illusions. Although most researchers share the view that issues related to mediated space are among the most significant factors characterising the new medium, as of yet, no coherent conceptual exploration of space and spatial representation in video and computer games has been undertaken. This thesis focuses on the novel spatial paradigms emerging from computer and video games. It aims to develop an original theoretical framework that takes the hybrid nature of the medium into account. The goal of this work is to extend the present range of methodologies directed towards the analysis of digital games. In order to reveal the roots of the spatial apparatus at work an overview of the most significant conceptions of space in western thought is given. Henri Lefebvre\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s reading of space as a triad of perceived, conceived and lived space is adopted. This serves to account for the multifaceted nature of the subject, enables the integration of divergent spatial conceptions as part of a coherent framework, and highlights the importance of experiential notions of spatiality. Starting from Michel Foucault\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s notion of the heterotopia, game-space is posited as the dynamic interplay between different spatial modalities. As constitutive elements of the dynamic spatial system mobilized by digital games the following modalities are advanced: the physical space of the player, the space emerging from the narrative, the rules, the audiovisual representation and the kinaesthetic link between player and game. These different modalities are examined in detail in the light of a selected range of exemplary games. Based on a discussion of film theory in this context an original model that serves to distinguish between different visual representational strategies is presented. A chapter is dedicated to the analysis of the crucial and often overlooked role of sound for the generation of spatial illusions. It is argued that sound has to be regarded as the privileged element that enables the active use of representational space in three dimensions. Finally the proposed model is mobilised to explore how the work of contemporary artists relates to the spatial paradigms set forth by digital games. The critical dimension of artistic work in this context is outlined. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the impact of the prevalent modes of spatial practice in computer and video games on wider areas of everyday life.},

Rather than situating participants in simulated environments, which mimic the physical world, HRGs make use of physical world immersion by merging physical and digital spaces. Online multiuser environments already connect users who do not share contiguous spaces. With mobile devices, players may additionally incorporate interactions with the surrounding physical space. This article is a speculative study about the potential uses of HRGs in education, as activities responsible for taking learning practices outside the closed classroom environment into open, public spaces. Adopting the framework of sociocultural learning theory, the authors analyze design elements of existing HRGs, such as mobility and location awareness, collaboration/sociability, and the configuration of the game space, with the aim of reframing these games into an educational context to foresee how future games might contribute to discovery and learning.

The moderator effect was interpreted using Linville\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s "buffering hypothesis" (1987), which suggests that Ss with higher scores on self-concept are less prone to experience stress-related outcomes like somatization/anxiety symptoms.},

At the same time, the remediation of photography, in both technical and cultural modes, is occurring in the digital game. Although conventions surrounding "the camera" have commonly played a role in some game genres, with increased frequency a more literal transposition of the photograph is making its way into the game: from x-treme stunt photography to the shift of the role of photographer from narrative context to play dynamic. How and why is the practice of photography now being performed virtually in the digital game? What does this redundancy teach us about both the cultural role of photography and the evolving medium of the digital game?},

The aim of our BCI system is to provide an on-line "hit rat" game control with short response time and subject-specific adaptation of system parameters. Our BCI system is able to detect three different motor imagery-related brain patterns (imagination of limb movements: left hand, right hand and both feet) from the ongoing brain activity by using only five EEG channels. The best hit accuracy of the game with fast response time attained by subject 2 is about 73\%, which demonstrates that our BCI system has the ability of providing much fast BCI of even 1 s per command.},

Guidelines include preserving the otherness of the game world, supporting knowledge and social networks of learners in virtual spaces, and the importance of point of view with respect to situated contexts.

How rich can the imposed story be, without breaking the gameplay? Are landscape and quest-structure the dominant factors in quest game design, to which the story-ambitions must defer?

abstract = {This work sought to help inform the design of educational digital games by the studying the design of successful commercial videogames. The main thesis question was: How does a commercially and critically successful modern video game support the learning that players must accomplish in order to succeed in the game (i.e. get to the end or win)? This work takes a two-pronged approach to supporting the main argument, which is that the reason we can learn about designing educational games by studying commercial games is that people already learn from games and the best ones are already quite effective at teaching players what they need to learn in order to succeed in the game. The first part of the research establishes a foundation for the argument, namely that accepted pedagogy can be found in existing commercial games. The second part of the work proposes new methods for analysing games that can uncover mechanisms used to support learning in games which can be emplyed even if those games were not originally designed as educational objects. In order to support the claim that \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}good\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} commercial videogames already embody elements of sound pedagogy an explicit connection is made between game design and formally accepted theory and models in teaching and learning. During this phase of the work a significant concern was raised regarding the classification of games as \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}good\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, so a new methodology using Borda Counts was devised and tested that combines various disjoint subjective reviews and rankings from disparate sources in non-trivial manner that accounts for relative standings. Complementary to that was a meta-analysis of the criteria used to select games chosen as subjects of study as reported by researchers. Then, several games were chosen using this new ranking method and analysed using another new methodology that was designed for this work, called Instructional Ethology. This is a new methodology for game design deconstruction and analysis that would allows the extraction of information about mechanisms used to support learning. This methodology combines behavioural and structural analysis to examine how commercial games support learning by examining the game itself from the perspective of what the game does. Further, this methodology can be applied to the analysis of any software system and offers a new approach to studying any interactive software. The results of the present study offered new insights into how several highly successful commercial games support players while they learn what they must learn in order to succeed in those games. A new design model was proposed, known as the \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}Magic Bullet\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} that allows designers to visualize the relative proportions of potential learning in a game to assess the potential of a design. },

Motivation has long been considered as an important step in learning. Researchers suggest Csikszentmihalyi\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Flow Theory as a method for understanding and implementing motivation. This bears significance since games foster play, which produces a state of flow, which increases motivation, which supports the learning process. However, this relationship is not as straightforward as it first seems. Research also shows that reflection is an important part of the learning process and while in the state of flow, players rarely reflect on the learning that is taking place. This paper explains how games can act as effective learning environments by integrating reflection into the process of play, producing an endogenous learning experience that is intrinsically motivating.},

abstract = {Background: Video games have become extensively integrated into popular culture. Anecdotal observations of young surgeons suggest that video game play contributes to performance excellence in laparoscopic surgery. Training benefits for surgeons who play video games should be quantifiable. Hypothesis: There is a potential link between video game play and laparoscopic surgical skill and suturing. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the performance of surgical residents and attending physicians participating in the Rosser Top Gun Laparoscopic Skills and Suturing Program (Top Gun). Three different video game exercises were performed, and surveys were completed to assess past experience with video games and current level of play, and each subject\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s level of surgical training, number of laparoscopic cases performed, and number of years in medical practice. Setting: Academic medical center and surgical training program. Participants: Thirty-three residents and attending physicians participating in Top Gun from May 10 to August 24, 2002. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were compared between participants\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} laparoscopic skills and suturing capability, video game scores, and video game experience. Results: Past video game play in excess of 3 h/wk correlated with 37\% fewer errors (P < .02) and 27\% faster completion (P < .03). Overall Top Gun score (time and errors) was 33\% better (P < .005) for video game players and 42\% better (P <. 0 1) if they played more than 3 h/wk. Current video game players made 32\% fewer errors (P = .04), performed 24\% faster (P < .04), and scored 26\% better overall (time and errors) (P < .005) than their non-playing colleagues. When comparing demonstrated video gaming skills, those in the top tertile made 47\% fewer errors, performed 39\% faster, and scored 41\% better (P < .001 for all) on the overall Top Gun score. Regression analysis also indicated that video game skill and past video game experience are significant predictors of demonstrated laparoscopic skills. Conclusions: Video game skill correlates with laparoscopic surgical skills. Training curricula that include video games may help thin the technical interface between surgeons and screen-mediated applications, such as laparoscopic surgery. Video games may be a practical teaching tool to help train surgeons.},

abstract = {Most serious games have been developed without a proper and comprehensive design theory. To contribute to the development of such a theory, this article presents the underlying design philosophy of LEVEE PATROLLER, a game to train levee patrollers in the Netherlands. This philosophy stipulates that the design of a digital serious game is a multiobjective problem in which trade-offs need to be made. Making these trade-offs takes place in a design space defined by three equally important components: (a) Play, (b) Meaning, and (c) Reality. The various tensions between these three components result in design dilemmas and trilemmas that make it difficult to balance a serious game. Each type of tension is illustrated with one or more examples from the design of LEVEE PATROLLER. \~{}},

abstract = {It is envisaged that computers of the future will have smart interfaces such as speech and vision, which will facilitate natural and easy human-machine interaction. Gestures of the face and hands could become a natural way to control the operations of a computer or a machine, such as a robot. In this paper, we present a vision-based interface that in real-time tracks a person\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s facial features and the gaze point of the eyes. The system can robustly track facial features, can detect tracking failures and has an automatic mechanism for error recovery. The system is insensitive to lighting changes and occulsions or distortion of the facial features. The system is user independent and can automatically calibrate for each different user. An application using this technology for driver fatigue detection and the evaluation of ergonomic design of motor vehicles has been developed. Our human-machine interface has an enormous potential in other applications that allow the control of machines and processes, and measure human performance. For example, product possibilities exist for assisting the disabled and in video game entertainment.},

abstract = {The beginning of the 21st century is being defined by new politics, the new economy, the information society, techno sciences, multiculturalism, globalisation and new lifestyles, all of which have some impact on art. Art is beginning to omit the nature of the stable artefact as well as the traditional functions of representation and embellishment and is becoming post-aesthetical and process-like. Because the key feature of the finished and stable artwork is not as important as it used to be, the ontological question of what art is has also become an issue of no great importance. Instead, relation questions regarding the interaction between art and techno-sciences, new technologies, the new economy and the new politics have arisen. The key concern of this essay is the highlighting of the cultural turns which have, in these days of the Internet, techno-sciences, the new economy and globalisation, influenced the new concepts and placements of contemporary art and digital textuality. Art 3.5 (a technical term used for the contemporary art of processes, installations, computer games, events, artistic communications, performances and art worlds) is placed in life in reality version 6.1 (another technical term), which has also mutated and undergone many changes. From the author\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s point of view the changes in the art field derive from the parallel changes in art\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s subsystem of reality 6.1. Therefore, one can determine in reality at the beginning of the 21(st) century that even techno-sciences, new technologies, the new means of communication, the new politics and new economy have, in a way, become artistic.},

A total of 14 young adults played 6 different BMCVGs for 6 min each and performed traditional cycling exercise in a randomized order. After two familiarization sessions, on a third occasion, subjects rated their enjoyment and completed the Flow State Scale-2 questionnaire. The BMCVGs were rated more enjoyable than traditional cycling exercise and the Flow dimensions Challenge-Skill Balance and Merging of Action and Awareness scored significantly higher than the norms for exercise activity and instead corresponded more closely to the norms for sporting activity. These findings suggest that BMCVGs could therefore act as a gateway for sedentary individuals to become involved in sporting activities.},

The implementation of more advanced features such as accelerated 2D and 3D graphics, videoconferencing, mobile multimedia, and games has raised performance requirements. The same holds true for other digital entertainment devices. Rapid advances in semiconductor technology, microarchitectures, and embedded systems have made the adoption of these features possible. As a result, software complexity will continue to increase to keep pace with overall system complexities.

My initial task is to establish the video game as a participatory rendering of the Hero’s Journey, while then breaking the cycle into individual components of motifs, themes and mythemes to parse the discourse of Journey’s exposition. I then argue for Journey’s ongoing engagement with reimagining the gaming experience through a commitment to synergistic immersion in a myth-minded environment.},

abstract = {The effects of violent media on behavior have been studied for decades. <strong>Less studied are the effects of prosocial media on behavior</strong> (Hogan, in press), <strong>especially in terms of video games.</strong> Following the design of Bushman and Anderson (2001) participants were assigned to one of three video game conditions: violent, prosocial, neutral. After playing for ten minutes, participants completed three stories (Car Accident, Persuading a Friend, The Room [about a messy roommate]) writing what would happen next (what would the protagonist do, say, think, feel). Responses were scored for violent (harmful, aggressive), prosocial (helpful, empathic, supportive), and neutral remarks. Across conditions there were no significant differences for aggressive responses. <strong>Importantly, the number of prosocial remarks in the prosocial condition was significantly greater than in the aggression or neutral conditions. Those in the prosocial condition produced more prosocial endings to stories. </strong>Playing video games creates social biases that influence feelings, attitudes, and behavior. Which biases are created are influenced by what kind of game is played. Playing positive games may increase the likelihood of thinking, feeling, and behaving morally and suppress the violent priming of videogame media generally. Media may be used in multiple positive ways to build moral character.

abstract = {The history of electronic games, as relatively short as it may be, can already be divided into several distinct personalities. To the game developer, this body of history represents a list of successes and failures compounded by the belief that if only he or she would have had as much polygonal power in 1987 as exists today, the failures would be fewer. To the game-consuming public, the history is a dull lesson that drops off just short of the second-to-last game system actually owned. The future, to game players, is possibly more important than the past. To the collector, the electronic games history is a bible to be revered and a reference to be digested and divulged at classic game conventions. To the academic, this history is a disorganized, infantile beast--full of discrepancies and confusion--that\&\#39;s waiting to be collected, sorted, observed, tamed, and pushed into the realm of true innovation.

Competence and autonomy perceptions are also related to the intuitive nature of game controls, and the sense of presence or immersion in participants\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} game play experiences. Study 4 surveys an on-line community with experience in multi-player games.

abstract = {Airports represent contemporary forms of mobility – existing as nodes that connect travelers and passengers to a series of other nodes within a global network of movement. The localized space of the airport itself is subject to such forms of global mobility – providing a gateway to international travel. As such, the contemporary, post-9/11 airport is a highly regimented space of surveillance – coding bodies and subjecting travelers to an ongoing forward and store flow of movement. This paper analyses the contemporary airport space and the possible subversions to surveillance-driven forms of mobility that the pervasive game Blowtooth offers. The game utilizes the surveillance space of the airport as the game space – where players are required to discreetly distribute and then collect forms of illegal contraband. This paper focuses on two figures of mobility/immobility: the passenger-in-waiting and the player-in-waiting. Conceptualizing play as a form of mobility and as a potentially subversive act, this paper examines how Blowtooth works within the structures of the airport space, and the subsequent forms of mobility and immobility afforded to travelers. This paper argues that Blowtooth subverts the space of the airport not only via a provocative narrative, but by playing with forms of mobility and immobility, and the store and forward flow of people within these highly surveilled spaces.},

Next, we describe how game reward systems can be used to motivate or change behaviors in the physical world. One of our main suggestions is that players can have fun with both rewards and reward mechanisms—enjoying rewards while reacting to the motivation that such rewards provide. Based on relevant psychological theories, we discuss how reward mechanisms foster intrinsic motivation while giving extrinsic rewards. We think that reward systems and mechanisms in modern digital games provide social meaning for players primarily through motivation, enhanced status within gaming societies, and the use of rewards as social tools.},

Then Mad University, a prototype online videogame specifically conceived and developed for this purpose, is explained. Findings - Human-like AI in artificial algorithms can be boosted by means of a specific kind of online videogame called MMORPGs, used as a research environment. Research limitations/implications - Mad University is a prototype videogame which has been developed to experiment with AI algorithms that aim to learn strategies in a generalized fashion. The next research step will be to improve Mad University and to put it to work with hundreds of players and then research and test the effectiveness of the AI algorithms.

In the paper we describe our work in using the Source engine from the game Half Life 2 to develop a serious game - Serious Gordon. Serious Gordon is used to teach principals of food safety and food hygiene in a restaurant kitchen environment. The target users of Serious Gordon are students of catering in the DIT Faculty of Tourism and Food. The paper describes the formation of the Serious Gordon team and the development of a story for the game. It continues with a description of the features from Half Life 2 that we retained and those that we removed for the game. We then describe the process we undertook to implement the game including a description of the tools we used. We conclude with a brief evaluation of the project and present future work.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the physical activity (PA) patterns and the hypothesized psychosocial and environmental determinants of PA in an ethnically diverse sample of obese and non-obese middle school children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: One-hundred and thirty-three non-obese and 54 obese sixth grade children (mean age of 11.4 +/-0.6). Obesity status determined using the age-, race- and gender-specific 95th percentile for BMI from NHANES-1. MEASUREMENTS: Objective measurements were collected of PA over a 7-day period using the CSA 7164 accelerometer: total daily counts; daily moderate (3- 5.9 METs) physical activity (MPA); daily vigorous physical activity (greater than or equal to 6 METs; VPA); and weekly number of 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (greater than or equal to 3 METs, MVPA). Self-report measures were collected of PA self-efficacy; social influences regarding PA, beliefs about PA outcomes; perceived PA levels of parents and peers, access to sporting and/or fitness equipment at home, involvement in community-based PA organizations; participation in community sports teams; and hours spent watching television or playing video games. RESULTS: Compared to their non-obese counterparts, obese children exhibited significantly lower daily accumulations of total counts, MPA and VPA as well as significantly fewer 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of MVPA. Obese children reported significantly lower levels of PA self-efficacy, were involved in significantly fewer community organizations promoting PA and were significantly less likely to report their father or male guardian as physically active. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that physical inactivity is an important contributing factor in the maintenance of childhood obesity. Interventions to promote PA in obese children should endeavor to boost self-efficacy perceptions regarding exercise, increase awareness of, and access to, community PA outlets, and increase parental modeling of PA.},

abstract = {Currently, several million people have accounts in massively multiplayer online games. The population of virtual worlds has grown rapidly since 1996; significantly, each world also seems to grow its own economy, with production, assets and trade with Earth economies. This paper explores two questions about these developments. First, will these economies grow in importance? Second, if they do grow, how will that affect real-world economies and governments? To shed light on the first question, the paper presents a simple choice model of the demand for game time. The model reveals a certain puzzle about puzzles and games: in the demand for these kinds of interactive entertainment goods, people reveal that they are willing to pay money to be constrained. Still, the nature of games as a produced good suggests that technological advances, and heavy competition, will drive the future development of virtual worlds. If virtual worlds do become a large part of the daily life of humans, their development may have an impact on the macroeconomies of Earth. It will also raise certain constitutional issues, since it is not clear, today, exactly who has jurisdiction over these new economies.},

abstract = {Distributed virtual environments (DVEs) are distributed systems that allow multiple geographically distributed clients to interact concurrently in a shared virtual world. DVEs, such as online games, military simulations, and collaborative design, etc., are very popular nowadays. To support scalable DVEs, a multi-server architecture is usually employed, and the virtual world is partitioned into several zones to distribute the load among servers. The client assignment problem arises when assigning the participating clients in the zones to servers. Current approaches usually assign clients to servers according to the locations of clients in the virtual world; i.e., clients interacting in a zone of the virtual world will be assigned to the same server. This approach may degrade the interactivity of DVEs if the network delay from a client to its assigned server is large. In this paper, we formulate the client assignment problem and propose two algorithms to assign clients to servers in a more efficient way. The proposed algorithms are based on the heuristics developed for the well-known terminal assignment problem. Simulation results with the BRITE Internet Topology Generator show that our algorithms are effective in enhancing the interactivity of DVEs.},

In this study, inexpensive and readily adaptable PC computer games were used to provide exposure therapy to 13 phobic participants and 13 non-phobic control participants. It was found that anxiety could be induced in phobic participants by exposing them to phobogenic stimuli in therapeutic virtual environments derived from computer games (TVEDG). Assessments were made of the impact of simulator sickness and of sense of presence on the phobogenic effectiveness of TVEDGs. Participants reported low levels of simulator sickness, and the results indicate that simulator sickness had no significant impact on either anxiety or sense of presence. Group differences, correlations, and regression analyses indicate a synergistic relationship between presence and anxiety. These results do not support Slater\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s(1) contention that presence and emotion are orthogonal.},

Design: Nonexperimental study. Setting: Survey data collected during the 2002-2003 school year. Participants: A nationally representative sample of 1491 children aged 10 to 19 years. Main Outcome Measure: Twenty-four-hour timeuse diaries were collected on 1 weekday and 1 weekend day, both randomly chosen. Time-use diaries were used to determine adolescents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} time spent playing video games, with parents and friends, reading and doing homework, and in sports and active leisure. Results: Differences in time spent between game players and nonplayers as well as the magnitude of the relationships among game time and activity time among adolescent game players were assessed. Thirty-six percent of adolescents (80\% of boys and 20\% of girls) played video games. On average, gamers played for an hour on the weekdays and an hour and a half on the weekends. Compared with nongamers, adolescent gamers spent 30\% less time reading and 34\% less time doing homework. Among gamers (both genders), time spent playing video games without parents or friends was negatively related to time spent with parents and friends in other activities. Conclusions: Although gamers and nongamers did not differ in the amount of time they spent interacting with family and friends, concerns regarding gamers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} neglect of school responsibilities (reading and homework) are warranted. Although only a small percentage of girls played video games, our findings suggest that playing video games may have different social implications for girls than for boys.},

Adaptive game AI (i.e., game AI that can automatically adapt the behaviour of the computer players to changes in the environment) can increase the entertainment value of computer games. Successful adaptive game AI is invariably based on the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s domain knowledge. We show that an offline evolutionary algorithm can learn important domain knowledge in the form of game tactics (i.e., a sequence of game actions) for dynamic scripting, an offline algorithm inspired by reinforcement learning approaches that we use to create adaptive game AI. We compare the performance of dynamic scripting under three conditions for defeating non-adaptive opponents in a real-time strategy game. In the first condition, we manually encode its tactics. In the second condition, we manually translate the tactics learned by the evolutionary algorithm, and use them for dynamic scripting. In the third condition, this translation is automated. We found that dynamic scripting performs best under the third condition, and both of the latter conditions outperform manual tactic encoding. We discuss the implications of these results, and the performance of dynamic scripting for adaptive game AI from the perspective of machine learning research and commercial game development.},

Based on media equation theory we could expect that moral emotions regulate social virtual interactions in a similar way as they do in real life (RL). However, emotions are also linked with involvement, and SL residents presumably are more involved in SL compared to non-residents. Via two quasi-experiments, we tested to what extent moral emotions felt when being cheated on by a love partner are comparable in intensity when this happens in SL versus RL. Results show that for SL residents the intensity of moral emotions did not differ between SL versus RL situations, whereas for non-residents a SL situation triggered less intense emotions. Further, for SL residents the level of involvement in SL had a significant impact on the moral emotions in response to a SL situation. In social virtual worlds, media equation thus seems to depend on involvement.},

Methods: Physical measures and self-report surveys were obtained from 837 ninth-grade girls attending public high schools in San Jose, California (mean age = 14.9 +/- 0.47 years; 36\% Latino, 24\% White, 22\% Asian, 8\% Black, 10\% other). Correlational and multiple regression analyses were performed with ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), perceived importance of appearance, weight concerns, and media use (based on self-reported average weekly use of television, videotapes, video and computer games, and music videos). Results: Total media use was not significantly related to perceived importance of appearance or weight con cems. When media use was separated into distinct media genres, only hours of watching music videos was related to perceived importance of appearance and weight concerns (r = 0.12, p < .001, and v = .08, p < .05, respectively). In multivariate analyses, after controlling for BMI and ethnicity, no media use variables were significantly associated with either perceived importance of appearance or weight concerns. Conclusions: Frequent music video use may be a risk factor for increased perceived importance of appearance and increased weight concerns among adolescent girls.},

We use logs from the participants in Quinn’s harassment to deconstruct the anatomy, techniques and methodology of misogynist online harassment, and how it is permitted and normalized by wider gaming culture. We stress that while this is not universal, it is wide-spread, insidious, and a major problem for video gaming culture. We conclude with a short discussion on the ways in which the issue can be addressed.},

abstract = {Computer games are an excellent e-learning platform for constructing student cognizance. The integrations of computer game and e-learning are a common and popular trend. However, most of these integrations focus on the transfer of knowledge (the e-learning content) as a "game-like" content based within a computer game. This is ineffective and meaningless due to the fact that students should be learning knowledge via the cognizance process. Computer games are merely a platform, a channel, and a tool. We should address and focus on the cognizance process. Computer games are an experience-based media which feasibly constructs player (student) knowledge through game playing. Thus, based on the problem solving theory, we proposed a framework which intends to replicate the revised bloom\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s cognitive processes in a computer game. Our depicted scenario is a computer game named Food Force, which will illustrate our proposed framework.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at product reviews from a cross-cultural perspective. Product reviews are potentially an influential form of marketing communication, as well as a predictor of sales performance. With Hofstede\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s typology as a backdrop, the basic proposition of this study is that collectivistic cultural values place more emphasis on giving face to others, even in impersonal social environments, resulting in them giving more positive product reviews than their individualistic counterparts.Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses content analysis of Chinese and American computer game reviews to test the hypotheses.Findings - The results showed that Chinese reviews use fewer negative comments and give higher final ratings for the same set of products than their American counterparts. In addition, Chinese reviews showed a lower consistency between their evaluative comments and their final ratings. Also confirmed is a common belief that final ratings are a summary of the evaluative comments of the review-texts.Research limitations/implications - Future research is invited.Practical implications - Theoretically, the study refines the understanding of differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Practically, it is suggested that if consumers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} cultural values are reflected in product reviews, international marketers should weigh and balance possible cultural bias when they decode evaluations of their products from reviews published in other countries\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} media.Originality/value - Product reviews are a rich but ignored resource with high marketing value. It is hoped that the study can stimulate both marketing researchers and practitioners to make better use of product reviews to further understand marketing phenomena and make better marketing decisions.},

abstract = {Real-time graphic applications and specifically videogames, follow a paradigm of continuous simulation that couples the simulation phase and the rendering phase. This paradigm can be inefficient (inadequate computer power distribution) or it can produce incorrect simulations (disordered events execution or events lost). The use of a decoupled discrete paradigm avoids incorrect simulations, besides it improves the simulation quality and efficiency. GDESK is a discrete decoupled simulation kernel that can be integrated in any videogame or real-time graphic application to change its simulation paradigm to a discrete decoupled one. Once GDESK is integrated inside the videogame, it becomes into a set of objects being communicated by messages. Messages are modeled using discrete events. GDESK manages the messages exchange process (events synchronization, messages sending and reception process, etc.). },

Why is it then, that most games are not developed to include women as part of the audience? This text explores the answers to this question and examines the relationship between women and computer games, both the women in the gaming industry and the women who serve as a market or potential market for computer games. Written for game designers, developers and publishers, the book explains the benefits of considering gender differences in game development and marketing. Using popular game titles as examples, the book explores why these games appeal to such a predominantly male audience, and investigates the key differences between male and female entertainment criteria. It also explains how males and females differ in regard to reward systems and learning styles, and how this information can be used to enhance game play.},

abstract = { Traditionally, educational researchers and practitioners have focused on the development of youths\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} critical understanding of new media as one key aspect of digital literacy ( Buckingham, 2003; Gilster, 1997). Today, youth not only consume media when browsing the Internet and sharing information on social networking sites, but they also produce content when contributing to blogs, designing animations, graphics, and video productions ( Ito et al., 2009). This new media landscape suggests an extension of what critical participation means in new media literacy, extending the metaphor of \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}reading the world to read the word\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} ( Freire \& Macedo, 1987) to include writing new media texts in a digital era. In an effort to map out the participatory competencies needed in this new media landscape, Jenkins, Clinton, Purushotma, Robinson, and Weigel (2006) included creative designs, ethical considerations, and technical skills to capture youths\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} expressive and intellectual engagement with new media. More recently, these efforts to produce your own media have also been associated with the growing do-it-yourself, or DIY, movement ( Guzzetti, Elliott, \& Welsch, 2010; Lankshear \& Knobel, 2010), involving arts, crafts, and new technologies ( Eisenberg \& Buechley, 2008; Spencer, 2005). Educators should be especially interested in DIY communities given the amount of time youth voluntarily spend in intense learning as they tackle highly technical practices, including film editing, robotics, and writing novels among a host of other activities across various DIY networks. },

Building on a social-interactional view of learning, it analyses some of the detailed practices through which players attend to a video game as the material and semiotic structure that shapes play and creates affordances for additional language learning. We describe how players engage with the language resources offered by the game, drawing on the vocabulary, constructions, prosodic features and utterances modelled on game dialogue, in building their own actions during collaborative play. With these resources, the players display their ongoing engagement with the game as well as their competences in recognising, reproducing and creatively reshaping the available linguistic resources in their own activities.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether flow experience, perceived enjoyment, and interaction affect people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s behavioural intention to play online games and whether gender, age and prior experience have moderating effects on online game acceptance.Design/methodology/approach - This study extends the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) with flow experience, perceived enjoyment, and interaction to propose a theoretical model to explain and predict people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s behavioural intention to play online games. This model is examined through an empirical study involving 458 participants using structural equation modelling techniques. In addition, a competing model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) is proposed to evaluate whether TPB is more suitable than TAM to explain the use of online games. The two action-theoretical models are compared in terms of their predictive power and their practical utility.Findings - Although both models explain the players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} intention to play online games very well, the extended TPB model provides a better fit and explanatory power. Notably, this study finds that flow experience is a more important factor than perceived enjoyment in influencing customer acceptance of online games. Further analysis reveals that gender is a key moderator of online game acceptance. Practical implications - Online game developers need to search for flow experience building strategies that might assist in engaging players. This study suggests that game developers should consider focusing more on establishing the interactions between players (social interaction) and online games (human-computer interaction) in their marketing strategies.Originality/value - This study is significant for two reasons. First, it synthesises the theory of planned behaviour with psychological and interaction factors and, second, it presents a blueprint for an entertainment-oriented technology acceptance model.},

@article{Bizzocchi2007,
abstract = {The paper considers the recent academic struggle between "narratologists" and "ludologists", and argues that it was exacerbated by two sources of confusion. The first confusion was differing concepts of immersion as an outcome of mediated experience. "Suspension of disbelief" and "flow" are both immersive states, but they grow out of fundamentally different processes of engagement. The second confusion was the conflation of "story" with the concept of a narrative arc. Interaction necessarily interferes with authorial control over the timing and the details of the narrative arc, and makes it a misleading focus for analysis or understanding of game narrative.
The paper maintains that if we ignore the concept of a grand narrative arc, we are free to examine other parameters of story within the game, which may be more limited, but are also more relevant.

Many suggest that increasing levels of obesity among children is the direct result of declining levels of physical activity. There is accumulating evidence that physical activity among youth has declined over the past several decades, Less time is spent on physical education classes in school and many popular activities among youth such as television and computer games, involve minimal physical exertion. These observations are confirmed by studies of physical fitness and endurance, These measures have also declined among youth, Much has been learned about the factors associated with physical activity among youth, These factors were used to develop several innovative school-based programs which demonstrate increased physical activity and performance, Recommendations are made for increasing physical activity both in the school curriculum and outside the school day, Potential health benefits and likely effects on obesity are substantial.},

The guild under investigation in this paper is a self-labeled “safe space” guild for female, LGBT, and other minority members of the gaming population. To promote the safe space environment, the guild’s members actively enforce prohibitions against offensive language. A comparison is made between the participatory surveillance model employed by the members of the guild and the top-down policies and discipline enacted by the parent company, Blizzard Entertainment; this comparison demonstrates the effects of co-existing models of surveillance in the game community. Furthermore, the effects of the guild’s practice of public discipline of rule breakers are analyzed as a soft form of shaming that enhances the effects of the guild’s rules. Finally, by examining reactions from members of the guild, personal and community empowerment are the outcomes of participation in the system. Recommendations are made to incorporate elements of participatory surveillance into games in conjunction with unilateral surveillance typically employed by game developers.},

The nexus between dramatic conventions, gameplay and traditional video production techniques will be explored. Participants will work with a short piece of a machinima, in the form of a scene created using the Sims 2 game. Participants will improvise, script and perform dialogue to provide meaning for the action. This workshop applies the insights of process drama, a field well developed in educational settings, to the development of machinima.

We draw on what speech act theory says about how trust, meaning and communication are achieved in human conversation, applying these notions to interactive storytelling.

We demonstrate how the amount of relative attention paid to key subjects of narrative importance may guide the outcome of a narrative branching. An experiment was conducted to test the operation of gaze guided film. The experiment involved 11 subjects influencing a two-minute film clip by gaze in two scenarios. In the first case subjects were aware that gaze could be used to control the narrative, and in the second case the subjects were unaware of this control. The outcome was found to be quite uniform across subjects, and it was not influenced by repetitions or by knowledge about the control option. Comments from the aware users indicated that they were looking for confirmation of gaze selections from the system. Thus, non-intrusive feedback seems to be fundamental for a successful gaze-interactive media. We suggest a range of discrete audio and visual effects that may serve this purpose and present some narrative control principles.},

abstract = {While much literature on girls and video games offers games for girls as presenting an empowerment through the possibility f or girls of active engagement and the possibility of honing skills to win, this paper argues that things are not so simple. Based on a study of children between the ages of 8 and 11 playing video games in after school clubs in Sydney, Australia, the paper argues that most video games are one site for the production of contemporary masculinity. On this basis it is argued that girls playing games have to negotiate complex performances which demand qualities traditionally ascribed to masculinity alongside those ascribed to femininity. This produces difficulties for girls in competing to win while at the same time displaying sensitivity, caring, and co-operation. This is discussed by analysing what happens when some girls play.

This article describes two studies that investigated the impact of these three features on girls\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} attitudes toward computer software. In the first study, forty-eight seventh-grade female mathematics students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: Female character/Competitive task, Male character/Competitive task, Female character/Cooperative task, and Male character/Cooperative task.

The subjects\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} scores on the CGAS were analyzed using a 2 x 2 ANOVA to examine to effects of learning environment (cooperative vs. competitive) and gender of character on girls\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} attitudes toward the computer software. In the second study, fifty-two sixth-grade female mathematics students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: aggressive distracters (via "snowbullies" thrown at the character) and no aggressive distracters (no "snowbullies").

The tools applied and examined were, on the one hand, the Aristotelian classification of the lack of self-control and, on the other hand, Fritzs thesis concerning the competence to regulate violence in dealing with computers. The results from this both theoretical and empirical analysis are quite clear. although the extensive use of violence-oriented computer games may in any case be described as uncontrolled, in the Aristotelian sense, it can, for the majority of the users, clearly not be defined as a lack of restraint with regard to violence because it is restricted to the virtual world. However, that minority of adolescents who make extensive use of violence-oriented computer games and whose thinking and acting shows great affinity to violence, may well be described as unbridled. The loss of control over violent actions among this group of the unbridled has-thus one of our central findings reached alarming proportions and a frightening quality.},

abstract = {In the recent years there have been several attempts to explore the nature of larping through Theatre Studies. For example improvisational theatre, Augusto Boal, psycho drama, and environmental theatre have all received their share of attention in the pursuit of a functional theory base for larping. Using theatre studies can help in mapping out the nature of larping by showing what it is not. But what can be done to locate the ‘yeses’? To offer another theoretical framework for larps as performances, this paper suggests the use of Performance Studies. Therefore, this paper will discuss the matter of larps, theatre and performance by, first, analysing the problems included in applying Theatre Studies for the exploration of the performance nature of larping, and second, by providing the reader with an introduction to Performance Studies and its possible usage on depicting the activity. It will be suggested that larp, essentially, is not theatre because the latter emphasises perception whereas the former emphasises action. Instead, this paper proposes that larping could be more precisely described as transportative performatic behaviour.},

One of the goals for achieving a realism that is believable for virtual characters is to overcome the Uncanny Valley where perceived eeriness or familiarity are rated against perceived human-likeness. Empirical evidence shows the uncanny can be applied to virtual characters, yet implies a more complex picture than the shape of a deep valley with a sharp gradient as depicted in Mori"s original plot of the Uncanny Valley. Our results imply that: (1) perceived familiarity is dependent upon a wider range of variables other than appearance and behaviour; and (2) for realistic, human-like characters, the Uncanny Valley is better replaced with the notion of an Uncanny Wall because the Uncanny Valley, as a concept, is not fully supported by the empirical evidence but, more importantly as a standard for creating human-like realism, is an impossible traverse.},

Analysis of the more negative social interactions within role-playing communities becomes necessary in order to establish a more complete picture of the psychosocial effects of these games. This research describes potential problems within role-playing communities in order to aid groups experiencing cohesion difficulties. This thematic, qualitative ethnography describes the types of social conflict occurring within role-playing groups and examines possible sources for their exacerbation. The study includes several types of role-playing from a phenomenological perspective, including tabletop, larp, and virtual gaming. Semi-structured interviews were collected from a selective sample of 30 international participants gathered from vastly different play cultures. While the types of games and methods of play contributed to conflict in some instances, striking similarities between the experiences of players across modes, cultures, and genres were observed. Emergent themes for sources of conflict included general problems inherent to group behavior, such as schisms, Internet communication, and intimate relationships. Other sources of conflict unique to the role-playing experience included creative agenda differences, the game master/player power differential, and the phenomenon of bleed, both in- and out-of-game. Potentially conflict-inducing play styles included long-term immersion into character, campaign-style, and competitive play.},

For obstacle avoidance, the algorithm considers both physical dimensions of the human and actions such as jumping, bending, etc. Path smoothening is carried out to keep the cell path as closely as possible to Euclidean straight-line paths.},

Less common stimuli are rotating helicopter blades, disfunctioning fluorescent lighting, welding lights, etc. New potentially provocative devices turn up now and then unexpectedly. During the last decades especially, displays have become increasingly dominant in many of our daily-life activities. We therefore focus mainly on the characteristics of artificial light and on current and future developments in video displays and videogames.

Influences of parental PA on adolescents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} activity level have been studied with discordant results and the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on these relationships is not clarified. Methods: Cross-sectional population-based survey of about 3000 12-year old French students and their parents. Familial associations were assessed with logistic regression models taking into account SES and children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s and parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} corpulence. Sport involvement and sedentary behaviors were assessed by standardized questionnaires filled out separately by children and parents, the latter also reporting their educational data and family income tax. Results: Participation in structured PA outside school was higher for boys (74\%) than for girls (58\%, p<10(-5)) and a high sedentary behavior (watching television, playing computer/video games and reading greater than or equal to2h/day) was observed in one-third of the sample, both in boys and in girls. Children were more likely to participate in structured PA outside school when both parents practiced sport as compared to neither parent practicing it, with an odd ratio OR (95\%Cl) of 1.97 (1.4-2.8) for boys and 1.56 (1.2-2.1) for girls. Familial associations of inactivity were significant for boys only. A greater percentage of adolescents had a high level of sedentary behavior when both parents versus no parents watched television >2h/day (OR 1.95 (1.5-2.6)). Parent-child physical activity relationships were not modified by the family SES or the children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s or parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} weight status. Conclusion: Parental involvement in sport is an important correlate of a young adolescent\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s participation in structured PA outside school, whatever the family SES or corpulence of the family members.},

They felt more integrated into the community in Whyville, where they enjoyed equal participation with other members, than as guests to the virtual town of River City.

abstract = {Mobile terminals have evolved from basic portable telephones to complex and diverse devices that encompass dozens of other features, ranging from tri-dimensional games to office suites with data transmission capabilities. Variability is value: mobile terminal manufacturers must succeed in fulfilling the requirements of hundreds of mobile telecom operators worldwide, and at the same time increase the value of their brand by adopting a common user interface style while offering the features that the target end-user category desires. This makes for practically infinite variability and creates a business problem. The complexity of the variability problem increases due to issues such as the ability to \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}plug and play\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}feature descension\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} (the down-scaling of high-end features and their introduction into lower-end models). The main lesson we have learned from our experience in this field is that the application of relatively simple architectural patterns usually eases up management of the complexity at the architectural level. However, tackling the variability problem at the technical level is ineffective unless the organization is able to ensure the application of the solutions. We analyze the main challenges that lie behind the variability problem in mobile terminals, at both technical and organizational level, and illustrate some of the solutions we have implemented together with our product developers and system architects. Our experience calls for more applied research in the area of variability management, as well as for a number of enhancements to academic curricula. Copyright \&COPY; 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper investigates issues of character believability and intelligent personalization through a reading of the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Oblivion's opening sequence simultaneously trains players in the function of the game, and allows them to customize their character class through the choices and actions they take. Oblivion makes an ambitious attempt at intelligent personalization in the character creation process. Its strategy is to track early gameplay decisions and "stereotype" players into one of 21 possible classes. This approach has two advantages over a less adaptive system. First, it supports the illusion of the game world as a real world by embedding the process of character creation within a narrativised game-play context. Second, the intelligent recommendation system responds to the player's desire to believe that the game "knows" something about her personality. This leads the players to conceptualize the system as an entity with autonomous, humanlike knowledge. Through the analysis of multiple replayings of the opening sequence, this paper considers ways in which Oblivion both succeeds and fails at mapping player behaviour to appropriate class assignments. The paper documents places where the dialogue between player and game breaks down, and argues for alternative techniques to customize the play experience within the desires of the player.},

Dynamic changes in anxiety and aggression evoked by playing an "aggressive" computer game were shown to be dependent on the initial level of aggression and conflict. An increase in P300 in the frontal and orbitofrontal areas of both hemispheres was observed in adolescents with initially high level of aggression and conflict. In adolescents with initially low aggression and conflict, P300 decreased bilaterally in the frontal areas and did not change significantly in the orbitofrontal areas. These findings testify to the bilateral frontal top-down control over negative emotions.},

A growing body of research is linking violent video game play to aggressive cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors. The first goal of this study was to document the video games habits of adolescents and the level of parental monitoring of adolescent video game use. The second goal was to examine associations among violent video game exposure, hostility, arguments with teachers, school grades, and physical fights. In addition, path analyses were conducted to test mediational pathways from video game habits to outcomes. Six hundred and seven 8th- and 9th-grade students from four schools participated. Adolescents who expose themselves to greater amounts of video game violence were more hostile, reported getting into arguments with teachers more frequently, were more likely to be involved in physical fights, and performed more poorly in school. Mediational pathways were found such that hostility mediated the relationship between violent video game exposure and outcomes. Results are interpreted within and support the framework of the General Aggression Model. },

Many people of all ages play games, such as board games, PC games or console games. They like game play for a variety of reasons: as a pastime, as a personal challenge, to build skills, to interact with others, or simply for fun.
</p>
<p>
Some gamers prefer board games over newer genres, because it allows them to socialize with other players face-to-face, or because the game play can be very improvisational as players rework the rules or weave stories around an unfolding game. Conversely, other gamers prefer the benefits of digital games on PCs or consoles. These include high quality 3D graphics, the adaptive nature of game engines (e.g. increasing levels of difficulty based on player experience) and an abundance of digital game content to explore and experience. With the increasing digitization of our everyday lives, the benefits of these separate worlds can now be combined, e.g. in the form of digital tabletop games. This emerging game type is played on a table that provides both an embedded display and a computer to drive player interactions with the game. Several people can thus sit around the table and play digital games together.
</p>
<p>
In tangible games, everyday physical objects, such as pawns or dice, can be detected and tracked, e.g. on the surface of the tabletop display. The tracking can be done with diverse technologies, such as optical cameras, RFID tags or sound (see Mazalek 2006, for an overview). The information from the tracking technology is then used as input for the game, which in turn provides visual output. For example, when a pawn has been moved across a display, the game can respond by ending the pawn owner\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s turn and showing the appropriate visual feedback. The next pawn can then be moved by one of the other players.

abstract = {Recent research demonstrates that videogames enhance literacy, attention, reaction time, and higher-level thinking. Several scholars have suggested that massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) such as Everquest and Second Life have educational potential, but we have little data about what happens when such tools are introduced in the classroom. This paper reports findings from two MMO- based courses in the context of situated learning theory. The first course, focused on the ethnography of on- line games, used the game Everquest as a vehicle for teaching research methods to 36 students in an undergraduate communication course. The second course used the game Second Life to teach the fundamentals of videogame design and criticism. Synthesizing comments from student web logs with data collected from followup surveys, the paper highlights key findings and offers concrete suggestions for instructors contemplating the use of multiplayer games in their own courses. Recommending that potential virtual environments be selected on the basis of genre, accessibility, and extensibility, it is suggested that game- based assignments are most effective when they build bridges between the domain of the game world and an overlapping domain of professional practice.},

The education establishment is bureaucratic and self-effacing, endorsing the production of complacency over challenge.

abstract = {Computer games do not afford much physical activity and hence do not require significant energy expenditure, which can contribute to the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle. A \&quot;hand exerciser\&quot; handgrip can help strengthen hand and forearm muscles through a simple spring mechanism. We are presenting the mousegrip, an exertion interface to control computer games while simultaneously exercising hand and arm muscles based on a handgrip device. Unlike conventional vision or accelerometer-based exertion interface devices, the mousegrip is very low-cost and supports cheap force-feedback through a simple spring mechanism. Due to its low cost, its mobile form factor and compatibility to existing mouse drivers, the mousegrip can augment traditional mouse interactions with an exertion activity to make exercising more enjoyable, and gameplay healthier. It provides a familiar affordance of interaction and supports increased calorie expenditure, hence contributing to people\&\#39;s fitness. We hope to encourage other researchers to incorporate exertion activity into their interfaces in order to support a healthy lifestyle.

It combined self-reported survey data with unobtrusive behavioral data from server logs of a large virtual world, EverQuest II. Over 5,000 players were surveyed about how they use the Internet, their specific activities in the virtual world, and their psychosocial well-being. In-game communication networks were also constructed and analyzed. The results showed support for both time displacement and social augmentation effects for various activities. Whether Internet and MMO use were associated with negative or positive outcomes was largely dependent on the purposes, contexts and individual characteristics of users. The results suggest that Internet use and game play have significant nuances and should not be considered as monolithic sources of effects.},

abstract = {Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are an increasingly popular class of real-time interactive distributed applications that require scalable architectures and parallelization approaches. While games of the role-playing genre already allow thousands of users to concurrently participate in a single game session, there are important genres, in particular action and strategy games, which have not been scaled to the massively multiplayer realm so far. These games have hard requirements in terms of scalability, in particular regarding density: many players tend to congregate in small locations. In this paper, we outline our novel approach of replication-based parallelisation for scaling the density of players. The practical impact of our work is demonstrated by porting the popular action game QFusion, based on the famous Quake 2, onto our proxy-server system architecture using the replication approach. The experiments with the ported QFusion demonstrate its high responsiveness and show that our approach allows to almost triple the maximum number of simultaneous players on four servers as compared with a single-server version.

Several gender differences in addictive tendencies were also revealed: Men scored higher than women on addiction to alcohol, cigarettes, gambling, television, and Internet use, but women scored higher on caffeine and chocolate.

The target may be either a type (iii) cooperator (with a known cooperation probability c) or a type (ii) evader. This formulation models search problems like that for a lost teenager who may be a \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}runaway,\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} or a lost intelligence agent who may be a defector. In any given search context, it produces a continuum of search problems F(c), 0 less than or equal to c less than or equal to 1, linking a zero-sum search game (with c = 0) to a rendezvous problem (with c = 1).

The current study sought to extend previous literature by using well-validated clinical outcome measures for relevant constructs, which have generally been lacking in past research. Cross-section data on aggression, visuospatial cognition, and math achievement were available for a sample of 333 (51.7 \% female) mostly Hispanic youth (mean age = 12.76). Prospective 1-year data on aggression and school GPA were available for 143 (46.2 \% female) of those youth. Results from both sets of analysis revealed that exposure to violent game had neither short-term nor long-term predictive influences on either positive or negative outcomes. A developmental analysis of the cross-sectional data revealed that results did not differ across age categories of older children, preadolescents or adolescents. Analysis of effect sizes largely ruled out Type II error as a possible explanation for null results. Suggestions for new directions in the field of video game research are proffered.},

Finally, we discuss the use of clinical intervention, education, and filtering software as strategies for managing the possible violent effects of video games. The inconsistencies in the findings from a vast body of research and the rate of advancement in video game technology make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the relationship between exposure to video game violence and aggressive behaviour. However, it is concluded that there is preliminary evidence that violent video games may have an antisocial effect on young players.

These properties affect how historical data and memory are organized, providing conceptual linkages for mind-machine integration. The distinction between accuracy and flexibility is also apparent in present-day computer simulations that use historical scenarios, such as virtual-reality software design for the Bloody Sunday Inquiry history-based video games other art and entertainment software applications. The contemporary examples share one important feature of extended mind: the incorporation of history or personal memory into a shared me system.},

This analysis is the result of work done by our research team in primary and secondary education in Spain. Our interest is to analyze how content and strategies in education should be learnt via the use of digital games. During the last decade, the amount of research on this field has increased considerably. The problem of integrating videogames into education will lessen over time and, in particular, as a consequence of pedagogical proposals that allow the integration of the experience of play with the learning experience. In this contribution, we describe the pedagogical model for the integration of the videogames used. We analyze the results obtained in relation to those obtained in similar studies. Finally, we consider the most important advantages and disadvantages of the use of videogames in schools.},

abstract = {This paper presents an original solution to the camera control problem in a virtual environment. Our objective is to present a general framework that allows the automatic control of a camera in a dynamic environment. The proposed method is based on the image-based control or visual servoing approach. It consists of positioning a camera according to the information perceived in the image. This is thus a very intuitive approach of animation. To be able to react automatically to modifications of the environment, we also considered the introduction of constraints into the control. This approach is thus adapted to highly reactive contexts (virtual reality, video games). Numerous examples dealing with classic problems in animation are considered within this framework and presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Situated Research offers in-depth video game analysis, accomplished by recording and analyzing player interaction within situated gaming environments. Techniques will be presented which uncover user practices and behaviors, aimed at uncovering a balance between aesthetics and functionality while maximizing interactive experiences. Research will be presented that outlines how to unpack gameplay experiences, so designers can design situations that yield intended, meaningful outcomes with lasting results.

The cutting-edge research approach described draws from a multi-disciplinary background to construct a very detailed picture of actual use, which informs the design process. Existing literature supports the idea that games can communicate complex ideas through exploration and play-testing, using constant feedback and assessment, by observing players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} behavior through interaction with other related objects in an environment. The design of specific visualizations, rules, and behaviors will be discussed, with impacts on human interaction and game play. By studying relationships among game interfaces and player behavior, patterns can be found that help to maximize motivation and flow, a feeling where one loses track of time and their surroundings (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).

In addition, research outlining the importance of role specialization and complimentary virtual identities in games like MMORPGs is presented, highlighting the importance of role-specialization, where group participation is required for success: such as guild formation, where characters of different ability work together towards mutual goals. Research methods addressing group activities and specialization (assuming roles) will be described, with effects on engagement: e.g., social ties to play games.

A blended method drawing from ethnomethodology (Garfinkel, 1967; Clayman \& Maynard, 1995) and grounded theory (Glaser \& Strauss, 1967; Charmaz, 2005) will describe how to go about finding patterns in gameplay, helping to design situations that yield intended, meaningful outcomes with lasting results. This open-ended approach allows observation of game players while they act in their natural environment, \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}in-situ\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\}, obtaining information that is highly relevant to the players themselves. Applying these results to game design can yield more effective, fun and playable games.},

abstract = {Video games and gambling often contain very similar elements with both providing intermittent rewards and elements of randomness. Furthermore, at a psychological and behavioral level, slot machine gambling, video lottery terminal (VLT) gambling and video game playing share many of the same features. Despite the similarities between video game playing and gambling there have been very few studies that have specifically examined video game playing in relation to gambling behavior. This Study inquired about the nature of adolescent video game playing, gambling activities, and associated factors. A questionnaire was completed by 996 (549 females, 441 males, 6 unspecified) participants from grades 7-11, who ranged in age from 10- 17 years. Overall, the results of the study found a clear relationship between video game playing and gambling in adolescents, with problem gamblers being significantly more likely than non-problem gamblers or non-gamblers to spend excessive amounts of time playing video games. Problem gamblers were also significantly more likely than non-problem gamblers or non-gamblers to rate themselves as very good or excellent video game players. Furthermore, problem gamblers were more likely to report that they found video games, similar to electronic machine gambling, to promote dissociation and to be arousing and/or relaxing. },

Structural features of computer games, such as interactive tailoring, role playing, the element of fun, and narrative, were operationalized in the RightWay Cafe game to afford behavior rehearsal in a safe and entertaining way. Theories such as the health belief model, social cognitive theory, and theory of reasoned action guided the content design of the game to influence mediators of behavior change, including self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and behavior change intention. A randomized controlled evaluation study with pretest, posttest, and follow-up design demonstrated that this game was effective in teaching nutrition and weight management knowledge and increasing people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s self-efficacy and perceived benefits of healthy eating, as well as their intention to be on a healthy diet. Limited long-term effects were also found: participants in the game-playing group had greater self-efficacy than participants in the control group after 1 month.

The factors include (1) attention to and active processing of health promotion messages, (2) motivation to learn about health, (3) health knowledge and skills that are essential for implementing proper prevention and self-care, (4) self-concepts related to health, such as self-esteem and perceived self-efficacy for carrying out desirable health behaviors, and (5) communication about one\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s own health with peers, family, and caregivers who can provide social support for behavior change. This chapter includes a review of current research that confirms the importance of these factors in improving health behaviors and outcomes.

abstract = {There have been several sociologists who have written, sometimes quite extensively and informatively, on video games, and more commonly many within video games studies have tapped into wider sociological literatures. However, more generally, the willingness of sociology to engage with video games and gamer analysis has been rather underwhelming, and this is particularly significant, for as Neiborg and Hermes (2008) argue, video games offer a key area for developing our understanding of contemporary audience, consumer and production patterns. Similarly, the general level of engagement with sociological literatures within games studies has at times been fairly limited. Though writers sometimes draw on philosophical/sociological ideas, such as \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}the magic circle\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, which they claim are \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}social\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} concepts, there is little understanding or engagement with what this actually means. Hence, this paper offers a (further) critique of the magic circle and similar concepts, but argues that the key weakness of these concepts is their lack of engagement with, and applicability to, other spheres of social life. To this end, I suggest that the (also sometimes used in game studies) concept of frame analysis, does offer a more social theory; however, what is truly needed in game studies (reflecting the arguments of early criminological debates in the 1960s and 70s) is a \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}fully social theory\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} (Taylor, Walton \& Young 1973) of gaming. },

Data revealed that 11.9\% of participants (840 gamers) fulfilled diagnostic criteria of addiction concerning their gaming behavior, while there is only weak evidence for the assumption that aggressive behavior is interrelated with excessive gaming in general. Results of this study contribute to the assumption that also playing games without monetary reward meets criteria of addiction.

The argument forwarded here is, therefore, that we need to re- conceptualize our notion of narrative considerably in order for the concept to be productive in the context of games. This re- conceptualization needs to take into account the cybernetic nature of games and thus factor in the experiential dimension of the human as well as the formal properties of the game. Due to length limitations the paper will focus primarily on the experiential side of the game/player equation. This dimension has, so far, presented considerable difficulties in finding a solid theoretical model upon which to be based, resulting in overly vague conceptualizations thereof.

abstract = {Recently, the margins between gaming and feminism have become increas- ingly contentious (Salter \& Blodgett, 2012). This article addresses a cultural moment where masculine gaming culture became aware of and began re- sponding to feminist game scholars by analyzing GamerGate conspiracy doc- uments and social media discussions related to the now infamous ‘‘DiGRA fishbowl.’’ Worries about the opacity of academic practices and a disparaging of feminist knowledge-making practices dominate these documents. By look- ing at these discussions and practices through the lens of conspiracy theories (Fenster, 2008; Hofstadter, 1952) and counterknowledge (Fiske, 1994) we consider the broader meaning of GamerGate’s attention to academia.},

abstract = {Rather than simply identifying "emergence" as a prime property of massively multiplayer online game life, a better understanding of the complex nature of player-produced culture is needed. Life in game worlds is not exempt from forms of player-based regulation and control. Drawing on ethnographic and interview work within World of Warcraft, the author undertakes initial inquiries on this subject by looking at three areas: nationalism, age, and surveillance. This case study shows systems of stratification and control can arise from the bottom up and be implemented in not only everyday play culture but even player-produced modifications to the game system itself. Due to the ways these systems may simultaneously facilitate play, there is often an ambivalent dynamic at work. This piece also prompts some methodological considerations. By discussing field site choice, the author argues that context is of utmost importance and needs to be more thoughtfully foregrounded within game studies.},

abstract = {Exploration of virtual environments may be accomplished with different interface metaphors. Previous research suggests that vestibular and proprioceptive information provided by immersive interfaces facilitates spatial orientation on simple path-integration tasks. We examine whether these interface variables impact performance across paths of variable complexity. Our immersive interface provided all users the ability to conduct the search component of our task more efficiently. Our results, however, show that the immersive interface was no more effective than our nonimmersive one for maintaining orientation. In fact, the immersive interface had a negative impact on performance (absolute error) for individuals who had extensive experience with playing video games. When measured in terms of consistency of response, our results suggest that having extensive game-play experience will negatively impact orientation performance with both interfaces. We speculate that this is due to the conflicting nature of the skills that avid game players acquire in game-play versus those required to perform in our task.},

abstract = {New media technologies have long tapped into social hopes and anxieties, and the turmoil that follows their appearance offers a window into the social tensions of the time. Clashing sets of utopian and dystopian visions have typically resulted in an ambivalent portrayal of such technologies. Video games prove to be no exception. Through a content analysis of media frames in the USA\&\#39;s three leading news magazines, the reception and presentation of video-game technology was tracked over a thirty-year period, 1970-2000. The resulting patterns tell a story of vilification and partial redemption, owing to the mainstream acceptance of the medium and the aging user base. Fears of the negative effects from the new technology were hypothesized to come from a routine set of conservative worries. The results support this hypothesis. Moreover, the frames surrounding games, especially in the 1980s, reveal many of the key social tensions of the times, primarily those surrounding gender roles, the separation of age and racial groups, and the role of female parents within an increasingly technological society. The place of video games within the larger context of media history, and the social causes of the frames are discussed.

abstract = {Background. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States for both men and women among all racial and ethnic groups. Identifying risk factors early in life can facilitate use of preventive strategies to reduce risk and improve health status across the life span. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify modifiable (tobacco smoke exposure, physical inactivity, dietary fat intake, overweight, and high blood pressure ) and nonmodifiable (family history, gender, and age) cardiovascular risk factors in low-income preschool children. Methods: Low-income preschool children (N = 205) 3-5 years old were recruited to participate. Parents completed a multigene rational cardiovascular health history form and a 24-hour dietary recall for themselves and their child. The children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s height, weight, and BP were obtained. Results: Of the 205 children, 61\% reported ethnicity as Latino or Hispanic, 31.7\% non-Hispanic White, 1\% non-Hispanic Black, 3.9\% Asian, and 2.4\% mixed race. The number of males (50.7\%) and females (49.3\%) was similar. Only 22 (10.7\%) children had no identified cardiovascular risk factors. At least one modifiable risk factor was present in 179 (87.3\%) children. Fifty-two (25.5\%) children had a body mass index (BMI) >= 85th percentile for gender and age; 44 (22.3\%) had a systolic or diastolic BP over the 90th percentile for gender, age, and height; 128 (66.3\%) had a dietary fat intake of > 30\%; 77 (37.6\%) watched TV or played video games more than 2 hr/day; and 48 (23.4\%) were exposed to passive tobacco smoke. Discussion: The identification of cardiovascular risk factors in almost 90\% of presumably healthy preschoolers provides evidence to support testing of interventions that can improve health behaviors and reduce risks.},

abstract = {<p>
From security training simulations to war games to role-playing games, to sports games to gambling, playing video games has become a social phenomena, and the increasing number of players that cross gender, culture, and age is on a dramatic upward trajectory. Playing Video Games: Motives, Responses, and Consequences integrates communication, psychology, and technology to examine the psychological and mediated aspects of playing video games. It is the first volume to delve deeply into these aspects of computer game play. It fits squarely into the media psychology arm of entertainment studies, the next big wave in media studies. The book targets one of the most popular and pervasive media in modern times, and it will serve to define the area of study and provide a theoretical spine for future research.
This unique and timely volume will appeal to scholars, researchers, and graduate students in media studies and mass communication, psychology, and marketing.

In this paper, the game rules of Bingo are modified to design a competitive computer game, called EduBingo, for practicing arithmetic in a classroom. Based on our previous works and surveys of several digital games, four dimensions of challenges are identified for devising such educational games. A trail test was conducted to preliminarily evaluate the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s effects on learning, and, in particular, the influences of different dimensions of challenges on practice.},

important for its potential utility in increasing motivation, involvement, engagement, and providing an

stimulate emotional engagement, many researchers have explored several techniques, including enhancing
the story content, developing new algorithms for dynamically creating stunning visual effects, and
enhancing 3-D sound. In this paper, I describe a set of new design techniques based on a study of film and

Although male hoverflies have been observed to move in a manner consistent with motion camouflage to track females, the successful application of the technique has not previously been demonstrated. This article describes the implementation and results of a psychophysical experiment suggesting that humans are susceptible to motion camouflage. The experiment masqueraded as a computer-game competition. The basis of the competition was a game designed to test the comparative success of different predatory-approach strategies. The experiment showed that predators were able to approach closer to their prey (the player of the game) before being detected when using motion camouflage than when using other approach strategies tested. For an autonomous predator, the calculation of a motion-camouflage approach is a non-trivial problem. It was, therefore, of particular interest that in the game the players were deceived by motion-camouflage predators controlled by artificial neural systems operating using realistic levels of input information. It is suggested that these results are especially of interest to biologists, visual psychophysicists, military engineers and computer-games designers.},

Through a content analysis of three television-themed MMOGs targeted to children, Nickelodeon\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Nicktropolis, Cartoon Network\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Big Fat Awesome House Party and Corus Entertainment\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s GalaXseeds, I examine how this new development within children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s online culture operates in relation to existing industry practices of cross-media integration and promotion. Dominant trends identified in the content analysis are compared with emerging conventions within the MMOG genre, which is generally found to contain numerous opportunities for player creativity and collaboration. Within the cases examined, however, many of these opportunities have been omitted and ultimately replaced by promotional features. I conclude that all three case studies operate primarily as large-scale advergames, promoting transmedia intertextuality and third-party advertiser interests.},

We provide an overview of the literature with overall conclusions and recommendations regarding VG playing. Specific preventive measures concerning the physical characteristics of images included in commercially available VGs (flash rate, choice of colors, patterns, and contrast) can lead in the future to a clear decrease of this problem. In addition to the positive effect of such measures, the collaborative studies performed in France and in the rest of Europe have stressed the importance of a safe distance to the screen of greater than or equal to 2 m, and the less provocative role of 100-Hz screens.},

abstract = {New media are distrusted media, and computer games are the contemporary currency in new media. Computer game content, like other popular media content, is regulated in different jurisdictions by one of three general models: the open market in which consumption decides the availability of product, industry self-regulation in which industry bodies decide, and government regulation in which government or quasi-governmental bodies decide. Arguably, these models represent the twentieth century state of the art and fail to keep pace with changes in the aesthetics and technologies associated with interactive entertainment. In a networked economy alternative models exist to serve content gatekeeping functions, and they serve to close the lags and limitations that plague existing models. These alternatives include innovations such as user-generated classification and dynamic meta-tagging. This paper examines current classification approaches and their limitations, and presents alternative approaches with a hypothetical game title.},

Is the physician's primary duty to respect the woman's autonomy, or to promote behaviour that may be in the best interest of the fetus? The controversial concept of "fetal rights" or the "fetus as a patient" contributes to the notion that the pregnant woman and her fetus are potential adversaries. However, Canadian law has upheld women's right to life, liberty and security of the person and has not recognized fetal rights. If a woman is competent and refuses medical advice, her decision must be respected even if the physician believes that her fetus will suffer as a result. Coercion of the woman is not permissible no matter what appears to be in the best interest of the fetus.},

abstract = {The combination of psychophysiological and psychometric methods provides reliable measurements of affective user experience (UX). Understanding the nature of affective UX in interactive entertainment, especially with a focus on sonic stimuli, is an ongoing research challenge. In the empirical study reported here, participants played a fast-paced, immersive first-person shooter (FPS) game modification, in which sound (on/off) and music (on/off) were manipulated, while psychophysiological recordings of electrodermal activity (EDA) and facial muscle activity (EMG) were recorded in addition to a Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Results indicate no main or interaction effects of sound or music on EMG and EDA. However, a significant main effect of sound on all GEQ dimensions (immersion, tension, competence, flow, negative affect, positive affect, and challenge) was found. In addition, an interaction effect of sound and music on GEQ dimension tension and flow indicates an important relationship of sound and music for gameplay experience. Additionally, we report the results of a correlation between GEQ dimensions and EMG/EDA activity. We conclude subjective measures could advance our understanding of sonic UX in digital games, while affective tonic (i.e., long-term psychophysiological) measures of sonic UX in digital games did not yield statistically significant results. One approach for future affective psychophysiological measures of sonic UX could be experiments investigating phasic (i.e., event-related) psychophysiological measures of sonic gameplay elements in digital games. This could improve our general understanding of sonic UX beyond affective gaming evaluation.},

Consistent with predictions flowing from Social Information Processing Theory, the vast majority of messages were socioemotional and positively valenced, despite the ostensible game objective of fighting other participants. Experience level played an important role in message production. More experienced participants produced both more positive and fewer negative socioemotional messages than the less experienced and used more specialized language conventions (e.g., emoticons, scripted emotes, and abbreviations). The results are discussed in the context of previous research examining the effect of communication medium and interaction purpose on socioemotional and task message production.},

abstract = {Although many observations in patients with this intriguing type of epilepsy have been described and detailed studies have been performed, only a few meet the current criteria of class I or 2 evidence-based studies. In general, the selection bias is due to studying a referral population instead of the general population, and to different age and sex distributions of the subjects under study. Comparing the various studies is often difficult, because of differences in the populations studied (single seizures, epilepsy centre population, etc.), but also because of different methods (photic stimulator, flash frequencies, eye conditions, etc.) and the terminology used. Finally, and most crucial, in many studies there is often no information on how the data were actually obtained (EEG or clinical data or both?). The popular term "photosensitive" is used widely and applied to patients with a history of visually induced seizures, with and without a photoparoxysmal response (PPR), and to those with only a PPR. An overview of the "hard" data is given with future needs for a better understanding of this type of epilepsy and for improving the endophenotype for genetic research. It is important to standardise the studies as much as possible and describe in detail the methodology of the study, taking at least the above variables into account.},

Different from most current MMORPGs, the new scheme tries to bridge the gap between a real social world with a virtual RPG social world by introducing social relationship, social structure, and avatar personality into the game play. Adaptation of social network analysis to MMORPG virtual world design is also discussed. The objective is to increase a game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s long term appeal to players. Moreover, the paper also proposes a method to use data mining technique for intelligently selecting dynamically synthesized tasks so that the tasks will be most likely interesting to the players.

The following argument is based on informal feedback of game players, formal observations of navigation in virtual environments, and from discussions with researchers of medical visualization technologies. My hypothesis is that having an ergodically embodied sense of self (such as in computer games) enhances sequential spatial memory over traditional non-ergodic forms of entertainment (such as adventure books with survey maps, or traditional cinematic media). My proposed method of evaluation for analyzing and evaluating spatial cognition in an interactive virtual environment (such as a computer game), is to use brain scanning equipment.},

This paper describes how we began with an existing single-server online game engine and enhanced it to become a multiserver MMOG engine running on a grid. other approaches require that a game be specifically designed to scale to MMOG player levels. Our approach, using IBM OptimalGrid middleware (which provides an abstracted underlying grid infrastructure to an application) allowed us to reuse an existing game engine without the need to make any significant changes to it. In this paper we examine the design elements needed by an MMOG and provide a practical implementation example-the extension of the id Software Quake 110 game engine using OptimalGrid middleware. A key feature of this work is the ability to programmatically partition a game world onto a dynamically chosen and sized set of servers, each serving one or more regions of the map, followed by the reintegration of the distributed game world into a seamless presentation for game clients. We explore novel features developed in this work and present results of our initial performance validation experiments with the resulting system.},

abstract = {A simple and yet highly efficient, high-quality texture mapping method for surfaces of arbitrary topology is presented. The new method projects the given surface from the 3D object space into the 2D texture space to identify the 2D texture structure that will be used to texture the surface. The object space to texture space projection is optimized to ensure minimum distortion of the texture mapping process. The optimization is achieved through a commonly used norm preserving minimization process on edges of the surface. The main difference here is, by using an initial value approach, the optimization problem can be set up as a quadratic programming problem and, consequently, solved by a linear least squares method. Three methods to choose a good initial value are presented. Test cases show that the new method works well on surfaces of arbitrary topology, with the exception of surfaces with exceptionally abnormal curvature distribution. Other advantages of the new method include uniformity and seamlessness of the texture mapping process. The new method is suitable for applications that do not require precise texture mapping results but demand highly efficient mapping process such as computer animation or video games.},

Both groups studied the same curriculum unit over a 10 week period, however, in addition the experimental group developed computer games related to the unit using a game development shell. An analysis of pre- and post-unit scores on two standardized literacy test batteries revealed that the experimental students performed significantly better on one of the subtests, a measure of logical sentence construction (p = .002).

abstract = {Video games are enjoying fast-growing popularity, becoming a major component of young people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s social lives and leisure activities. Many players share information and conduct social interactions in virtual communities (VC). The current study sought to examine the relationships between members and leaders in such video game communities using a number of variables to describe the member (i.e., knowledge sharing, usefulness, enjoyability, off-site interaction, satisfaction, loyalty, and intention to use) and the leader (i.e., leader involvement). Based on a sample of 2227 members and 41 leaders in 30 video game communities, the research demonstrated the use of a two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the relationships of VC leaders and members, appropriately adjusted for a nested structure. The results indicated that leaders who engage in higher levels of involvement in VC are more likely to have members who agree with and respond to the community. Furthermore, member- and leader-level factors were significantly associated with member satisfaction: knowledge sharing, usefulness, and enjoyability explained within-VC variance while leader involvement explained between-VC variance. Finally, member satisfaction demonstrated positive effects on both member loyalty and intention to use. The study further discussed the implications of these findings, offering direction for future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we represent this problem as a constraint satisfaction problem which is often over-constrained. A range of complex requirements, such as frame coherence, occlusion and camera holes can be elegantly represented as constraints. We then apply both complete and incomplete search methods to find the optimal camera placement. An interactive computer games application was developed to experimentally evaluate these methods. Our experimental results and a discussion with related studies conclude that our approach is sophisticated both in modelling and solving the difficult task of 3D camera control.},

These essays from diverse theoretical perspectives expand the discussion by focusing scholarly analysis on the games, particularly Grand Theft Auto III (GTA3), Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (GTA:VC), and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (GTA:SA).Part One of the book discusses the fears, lawsuits, legislative proposals, and other public reactions to Grand Theft Auto, detailing the conflict between the developers of adult oriented games and various new forms of censorship. Depictions of race and violence, the pleasure of the carnivalistic gameplay, and the significance of sociopolitical satire in the series are all important elements in this controversy. It is argued that the general perception of digital changed fundamentally following the release of Grand Theft Auto III. The second section of the book approaches the games as they might be studied absent of the controversy. These essays study why and how players meaningfully play Grand Theft Auto games, reflecting on the elements of daily life that are represented in the games. They discuss the connection between game space and real space and the many ways that players mediate the symbols in a game with their minds, computers, and controllers.},

Along with the success of the massively multiplayer role-playing gaming industry in Asia, online gaming-related crimes have grown at an amazing rate. Most of the criminal cases are related to virtual properties since markets have developed for the virtual properties giving them real world values. There has been little research and resulting technologies for MMORPG virtual property protection. In order to reduce the crimes and protect online gaming systems, one potential solution is protecting the virtual properties in online gaming systems. In this paper, we propose a virtual property management language to meter the use of virtual property. The language provides a framework for managing the use of virtual properties and recording the history of transactions to trace the life of virtual properties.

@article{Jara2013,
abstract = {As texts which are based on collaborative and interactive narration, tabletop – also known as “pen and paper” – role-playing games (TRPGs) are distinct in their technological simplicity. Indeed, in their traditional form all they require is the physical presence of a group of players – commonly around a table, hence “tabletop” – who collaboratively participate in developing a narrative; and a system of rules which allow resolving the outcome of situations in which different levels of chance may be involved – the need to write down statistic information making them “pen and paper”. Evidently, this apparent lack of sophistication makes role-playing games – as a clearly contemporary cultural phenomenon (cf. Punday, 2005; Nephew, 2004; Harrigan, 2007; Mackay, 2001) – stand out in the context of a world that is becoming ever more dependent on technology. All the more so, considering the persistence of TRPGs in the face of its “descendants” in other more technologically advanced media and despite what has become the popular notion of “the bigger, the faster, the better.” Nevertheless, that which occurs during a role-playing game session – the level of interactivity, player immersion in the narrative, flexibility of the rules, etc. - generally surpasses, even today, what many of its “successors” achieve. How does this occur? How is it possible; through what mechanisms do TRPGs allow such sophistication when relying solely on the “old fashioned” technologies of (hand-) writing and oral narration? Approaching these questions from the general perspective of literary studies, the following paper problematizes what can be called a “na\"{\i}ve view” of communication technology by addressing the complex relationship between the printed texts used for role-playing – such as rule- and sourcebooks – and the narratives created during game-play. To do so, it addresses the fundamental influence that framings, such as rules, character sheets and setting, as well as paratextual elements contained within or at the borders of these texts, such as cover illustrations, prologues and epilogues, just to name a few – have on participants’ interpretation and, most importantly, creation of TRPG narratives.

As a result, a modified version of the task called "Catch the Spies" was developed. Participants tracked one to four moving "spies" (targets) that had "disguised" themselves so that they could blend in with a crowd of 10 people (happy-faces). Tracking accuracy was measured in live age groups (6, 8, 10, 12, and 19 years old). All performed well above chance though there were age-related increases in the number that could be tracked at once. Overall, when the effects of age were statistically controlled, tracking performance was significantly better for action videogame players than non-players, and marginally better for action-sports participants than non-participants.},

Method: Media categories researched with computer technology included television and movies, rock music and music videos. advertising, video games, and computers and the Internet. Results: Research prior to 1990 documented that children learn behaviors and have their value systems shaped by media. Media research since has focused on content and viewing patterns. Conclusions: The primary effects of media exposure are increased violent and aggressive behavior, increased high- risk behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco use, and accelerated onset of sexual activity. The newer forms of media have not been adequately studied. but concern is warranted through the logical extension of earlier research on other media forms and the amount of time the average child spends with increasingly sophisticated media.},

The main question was whether individual differences in performance can be diminished by means of training. Additionally, the susceptibility of different subsamples to cybersickness when rnoving within VEs was examined. 85 participants took part in an experiment where they had to fulfill simple tasks in three VEs. Navigation performance was measured as the time participants needed to make their way through the VEs. Differences in navigation performance between different levels of experience were diminished by training, indicating that internal validity can be obtained. A classification tree reveals that game-inexperienced female participants aged over 31 years have the highest risk of experiencing cybersickness. VEs based on modifications of computer games seem to be an extremely promising and inexpensive possibility for the administration of psychological experiments.},

Heart rate, the measure of arousal monitored, increased significantly above baseline during each trial, but there was no difference in this rise between trials. The main finding from this experiment was that after ingesting glucose, subjects had a stable blood FFA concentration during the videogame, while after the ingestion of placebo subjects had a significantly higher blood FFA during videogames than they had at baseline.

abstract = {The widely varying experiences of players of digital games challenge the notions that there is only one correct way to play a game. Some players routinely use cheat codes, consult strategy guides, or buy and sell in-game accounts, while others consider any or all of these practices off limits. Meanwhile, the game industry works to constrain certain readings or activities and promote certain ways of playing. In Cheating, Mia Consalvo investigates how players choose to play games and what happens when they can’t always play the way they’d like. She explores a broad range of player behavior, including cheating (alone and in groups), examines the varying ways that players and industry define cheating, describes how the game industry itself has helped systematize cheating, and studies online cheating in context in an online ethnography of Final Fantasy XI. She develops the concept of "gaming capital" as a key way to understand individuals’ interaction with games, information about games, the game industry, and other players. Consalvo provides a cultural history of cheating in videogames, looking at how the packaging and selling of such cheat-enablers as cheat books, GameSharks, and mod chips created a cheat industry. She investigates how players themselves define cheating and how their playing choices can be understood, with particular attention to online cheating. Finally, she examines the growth of the peripheral game industries that produce information about games rather than actual games. Digital games are spaces for play and experimentation; the way we use and think about digital games, Consalvo argues, is crucially important and reflects ethical choices in gameplay and elsewhere. Mia Consalvo is Associate Professor of Telecommunications at Ohio University.},

We identified 18 usability issues in MMORPG and presented a recommendation relevant to the issues. Empirical data were applied to a new heuristic evaluation framework. We determined the relationship between key factors and four game categories, such as game interface, game play, game narrative, and game mechanics. Moreover, the results presented 54 key factors for a new heuristic evaluation framework for game design. The conclusion presents key implications of our research in a game design context, particularly related to early design processes.},

This article examines a new version of Monopoly, titled Local Property Trader that works with NFC/QR code technologies in order to encourage players to move around the city and interact with local businesses. In doing so, the project hopes to highlight how location-based games can use social media data to update a traditional game into more contemporary contexts. Correspondingly, the differences and similarities of taking a boardgame and reworking it for the city streets are explored through ideas surrounding location, player and map as key points of intersection between the two media forms.},

abstract = {This paper explores the intersection of race, humour and interactivity in Grand Theft Auto 3. We argue that video games not only diffuse cultural and symbolic meanings, but also provide new loci for reflection and critique of issues of inter alia race. Two different analytical perspectives are juxtaposed when studying racial issues of GTA3. The first perspective is Critical Race Theory (CRT). The second perspective derives from the phthonic and incongruity theory of humour (Morreall 1986). We will argue that the CRT perspective is consistent with the phthonic theory of humour, while the incongruity theory goes beyond CRT presenting a novel way of interpreting games. This theoretical framework is applied when analysing the controversial game GTA3. By presenting stereotypical images of race in GTA3 as humorous, the player is provided with cues for reflecting and evaluating his/her own perspectives on issues of race.},

abstract = {Wikipedia might possibly be the best-developed attempt thus far of the enduring quest to gather all human knowledge in one place. Its accomplishments in this regard have made it an irresistible point of inquiry for researchers from various fields of knowledge. A decade of research has thrown light on many aspects of the Wikipedia community, its processes, and content. However, due to the variety of the fields inquiring about Wikipedia and the limited synthesis of the extensive research, there is little consensus on many aspects of Wikipedia’s content as an encyclopedic collection of human knowledge. This study addresses the issue by systematically reviewing 110 peer-reviewed publications on Wikipedia content, summarizing the current findings, and highlighting the major research trends. Two major streams of research are identified: the quality of Wikipedia content (including comprehensiveness, currency, readability and reliability) and the size of Wikipedia. Moreover, we present the key research trends in terms of the domains of inquiry, research design, data source, and data gathering methods. This review synthesizes scholarly understanding of Wikipedia content and paves the way for future studies.},

Participants make sizable investments Of social I human, and economic capital in these virtual worlds, often with the questionable expectation that the items they have collected and creations they have developed are their property. This Comment builds on previous scholarship by looking past abstract theoretical possibilities of whether property can exist in a virtual world to perform a systematic analysis of how end user license agreements actually allocate the property rights of use, exclusion, and transfer among virtual-world providers and participants. While there are some small differences from agreement to agreement in the commensurability of virtual goods and in the ability of Participants to recognize profit from their virtual creations, the agreements consistently give providers the plenary ability to impose sanctions on participants and to change the terms of the agreements. This uncertainty severely curtails the ability of Participants to enjoy the fruits of their investments. This Comment proceeds from this analysis to explore assertions of a reasonable right of access, contract claims, consumer protection claims, and possible legislative action that might help participants to protect these investments and encourage continued growth on this innovative frontier.},

abstract = {Because of the huge potential profit, the development of virtual items in massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) has lately begun receiving attention. As a successful means for developing new products, the quality function deployment (QFD) has been widely used in devising virtual items. In traditional QFD, information about the customers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} needs and their priorities can be gained through some marketing methods. However, these approaches heavily rely on the subjective results and cannot identify the demands of each customer because of bewildering amount of information. Thus, we adopt the genetic chaotic neural network (GCNN) technique to identify each customer\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s needs and their priorities and propose the enhanced qualify function deployment (EQFD). However, in most of the existing literature, the equations to describe chaos dynamics are fixed and rigid corresponding to different nonlinear dynamic systems. In fact, for many chaotic systems in applications, it is often difficult to obtain accurate and faithful mathematical models, regarding their physically complex structures and hidden parameters. Therefore, GCNN is proposed in this paper, where GA is embedded into the chaotic neural network to generate and refine the equations of chaotic systems. By experimenting our methods with several benchmark methods, the proposed GCNN is found to demonstrate a clear advantage over other identifying methods, and EQFD is proven to be a feasible technique for developing the virtual items in MMORPGs.},

abstract = {It is commonly accepted that the educational environment has been undergoing considerable change due to the use of the Information and Communication tools. But learning depends upon actions such as experimenting, comprehending, visualizing, abstracting and demonstrating, by means of which the learner succeeds in constructing his own knowledge. It is not always easy to achieve these actions through current distance learning approaches. Since we live in a society that demands creativity, globalization, responsibility, autonomy and the ability to deal with virtuality and new technologies, Role Playing Games (RPG) may well develop such capacities. The creation of an interactive computer game with RPG characteristics, about the 500th anniversary of the city of Funchal, the capital of Madeira Island, is invested with compelling educational/pedagogical implications, aiming clearly at teaching history and social relations through playing. By incorporating the concept "games to teach", players will interpret different characters in different settings/scenarios, experiencing adventures, meeting challenges and reaching multiple and simultaneous goals in the areas of education, entertainment and social integration along the first 150 years of the history of Funchal. Through this process they will live and understand all the social and historical factors of that age.},

abstract = {In the closing weeks of 2002, video games were featured in various popular American news publications and media outlets such as Wired, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek and Time Magazine. It is becoming increasingly apparent that video games are no longer child\&\#39;s play, but rather that they are poised to become a major entertainment form for the twenty-first century. Social analysts and media scholars must begin to formulate an understanding of this emerging mass-consumer phenomenon because it will increasingly impact social and economic structures of post-industrial societies. Part of the tremendous value generated by the American video-game industry is tied into broad global economic shifts that have created a space where services and ephemeral products, such as software, can be created and cheaply distributed. The predominance of \&quot; high-tech\&\#39; production, the rise of the Internet, and the cultural capital associated with computerization all have contributed to the rise of hobbyist software developers that currently tinker with commercial video games and freely add to them increasing levels of sophistication. This paper sees video-game programmer hobbyists as a source of some of the significant value that the video-game industry generates, and understands the role of the programmer hobbyists through the lens of theories on post-industrial work. My analysis situates the work of hobbyists on the Internet within the context of post-Fordism and explores some of the motivations for this unwaged work. In the sections that follow, I will analyse the potential value of the work hobbyist do as well as analyse its transition to paid work as some commercial software developers experiment with incorporating these fan bases into the game design process.

The wider market for computer games now exceeds the annual global revenues of cinema. We have, however, only a limited scholarly understanding of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular attention because their context is unique. Drawing on a case study, the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of the development process of creative software, such as games software. We found that the process, as constituted by the interactions of developers, oscillates between two modes of practice: routinized and improvised, which sediment and flux the working rhythms in the context. This paper argues that while we may predeterminately lay down the broad stages of creative software development, the activities that constitute each stage, and the transition criteria from one to the next, may be left to the actors in the moment, to the temporality of the situation as it emerges. If all development activities are predefined, as advocated in various process models, this may leave little room for opportunity and the creative fruits that flow from opportunity, such as enhanced features, aesthetics and learning.},

The objective of this research was to analyse the SHRM of these companies and to test the relevance of the Resource Based View of the firm, which states that Human Resources are all the more crucial for a given firm as they are specific, non imitable and socially complex (Coff, R. (1997) Academy of Management Review, Vol. 22, No. 2, pp.374-402.). On the basis of semi-directive interviews of HR operators, the stake was to characterise the HR practices of each company in connection with its strategy and development stage. We thus obtained a snapshot of SHRM\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s various profiles existing in this sector. We further analyse the possible rationales to explain a paradoxical finding: video games companies, as they grow, tend to get rid of their specific, socially complex and causally ambiguous assets (namely the creative skills) in favour of more generic set of skills (namely, the management skills).},

abstract = {Aims Some researchers suggest that for some people, video game playing is an addictive behaviour similar to substance dependence. Our aim,was to design and validate a scale to measure the problems associated with the apparently addictive use of all types of video games and video game systems, because there is no instrument at the present time that can be used for this purpose. Design We reviewed the DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence and for pathological gambling, as well as the literature on the addictions in order to design a short scale (PVP; problem video game playing) that is quick and easy to apply. Participants The scale was administered to 223 Spanish adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years. The study was carried out in Granada and Algeciras, Spain. Findings Psychometric analyses show that the PVP seems to be unidimensional and has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s alpha) at 0.69. The pattern of associations between the scale scores and alternative measures of problem play supports its construct validity (higher total scores in the scale were associated with higher frequency of play, mean and longest times per session, self and parents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} perception of playing to excess, and scores in the Severity of Dependence Scale). Conclusions Our results confirm that the excessive use of video games is associated with a number of problems which resemble a dependence syndrome, and the PVP appears as a useful instrument for the measurement of such problems.},

Physiological responses (heart rate and skin conductance) were measured during the experiment. After playing, information about state hostility and state anxiety was collected. The results showed that participants who played the violent game reported significantly higher state hostility, and support the assumption that an aggressive personality moderates the effect of playing a violent game on state hostility.},

As game systems become more ubiquitous, technical platforms will evolve to support more game-like interaction in general.

abstract = {When playing a video game, or using a teleoperator system, we feel our self-image projected into the video monitor as a part of or an extension of ourselves.

We earlier showed these neurons to code the schema of the hand which can be altered in accordance with psychological modification of the body image: that is, when the monkey used a rake as a tool to extend its reach, the visual RFs of these neurons elongated along the axis of the tool, as if the monkeys self image extended to the end of the tool. In the present experiment, we trained monkeys to recognize their image in a video monitor (despite the earlier general belief that monkeys are not capable of doing so), and demonstrated that the visual RF of these bimodal neurons was now projected onto the video screen so as to code the image of the hand as an extension of the self. Further, the coding of the imaged hand could intentionally be altered to match the image artificially modified in the monitor.},

The content of this activity was strongly biased toward more playful interests than the curricula agenda of the institution. This did not reflect unfavorable competition between the activity of study and other discrete activities such as computer games. Instead, the capacity of the desktop environment to provide strong distracting affordances for interaction and interruption is noted. This sustains a significantly mobile and multitasking style of engagement. We noted that the versatility of ubiquitous computing creates tensions in relation to the activity system of private study. The same characteristics that empower research-led study practices also empower the pursuit of interests in distracting competition with the demands of learning and research. Moreover, study may demand ways of acting that are not consistent with the affordances of ubiquity},

abstract = {Background: Use of television, computers, and video games competes with physical activity and may be a health risk factor. Purpose: This study assessed the relationship between leisure-based screen time and physical activity in families to determine whether assignment to a limited screen time group results in more physical activity. Methods: Ninety-four families participated for six weeks. Families were randomly assigned to unlimited or limited screen time viewing groups. Participants wore a pedometer to measure steps. Results: Results indicate no statistically significant differences in steps for adults (F(1,165)=0.81, p?.369) or 13-to-18-year-olds (F(1,63)=0.21, p?.647). Among the 5-to-12-year-olds, statistically significant group differences (F(1,165)=5.63, p?.019) for steps were found between the unlimited viewing group and the limited viewing groups. Discussion: Lower amounts of leisure-based screen time yielded increased amounts of physical activity in the 5-to-12-year-olds, but this trend was not found in the 13-to-18-year-olds or adults. Additional research is needed in order to more fully understand the screen time and physical activity relationship. Translation to Health Education Practice: In general, promotion of physical activity at home and school could increase physical activity and decrease leisure-based screen time; otherwise, other sedentary activities may only replace the time not spent in front of a screen.},

abstract = {It is believed that repeated exposure to real-life and to entertainment violence may alter cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, possibly leading to desensitization. The goal of the present study was to determine if there are relationships between real-life and media violence exposure and desensitization as reflected in related characteristics. One hundred fifty fourth and fifth graders completed measures of real-life violence exposure, media violence exposure, empathy, and attitudes towards violence. Regression analyses indicated that only exposure to video game violence was associated with (lower) empathy. Both video game and movie violence exposure were associated with stronger proviolence attitudes. The active nature of playing video games, intense engagement, and the tendency to be translated into fantasy play may explain negative impact, though causality was not investigated in the present design. The samples\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} relatively low exposure to real-life violence may,have limited the identification of relationships. Although difficult to quantify, desensitization to violence should be further studied using related characteristics as in the present study. Individual differences and causal relationships should also be examined.},

Firstly the importance of nonverbal and paraverbal modalities in two prototypical scenarios are discussed: face-to-face interactions in psychotherapetitic consulting and side-by-side interactions of children cooperating in a computer game. Some challenges in processing signals are stated with respect to both scenarios. The following technologies of acoustic signal processing are discussed: (a) analysis of the influence of the room impulse response to the recognition rate, (b) adaptive two-channel microphone, (c) localization and separation of sound sources in rooms, and (d) single-channel noise suppression.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to test the effect of individual differences on appeal and use of video games. Participants were 299 adolescent boys from lower and higher secondary schools in the Netherlands and Belgium. In general, boys were most attracted to violent video games. Boys that scored higher in trait aggressiveness and lower in empathy were especially attracted to violent games and spent more time playing video games than did boys lower in trait aggressiveness. Lower educated boys showed more appreciation for both violent and nonviolent games and spent more time playing them than did higher educated boys. The present study showed that aggressive and less empathic boys were most attracted to violent games. The fact that heavy users of violent games show less empathy and higher aggressiveness suggests the possibility of desensitization. Other studies have shown that playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy. These results combined suggest the possibility of a violence cycle. Aggressive individuals are attracted to violent games. Playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy, which in turn leads to increased appreciation and use of violent games.},

The focus then shifts to the ways in which existing laws and understandings about intellectual property are transforming to accommodate the unique characteristics of online multiplayer games. The contentious issue of labor within online gaming is discussed through a consideration of shifting social conceptualizations of play and the confounding of leisure and labor. The underlying use value/exchange value relationship is also explored within the theoretical framework of a political economic perspective.},

As with other new media adopted for use by instructional technologists for pedagogical purposes, barriers to classroom implementation have manifested in tandem with rising interest in the medium. This article draws upon a broad analysis of current research dealing with the educative impact of computer video games in the classroom, with a focus on these barriers to implementation. This study was a qualitative review of several scholarly papers exploring the use of computer video games in the classroom. Papers were chosen for inclusion in the review based on their focus on educational video game research. Review of the papers led to six major barriers, which are identified and summarized in this article. Barriers included negative perceptions toward video games as educational components; the difficulty of providing state of the art graphics in educational video games; a lack of adequate computing hardware in the classrooms to run advanced video games; a school day divided by short class periods which hindered long term engagement in complex games; a lack of real world affordances; and a lack of alignment to state standards. Implications for each barrier and suggestions for future research round out the findings.},

abstract = {For daily burn wound care procedures, opioid analgesics alone are often inadequate. Since most burn patients experience severe to excruciating pain during wound care, analgesics that can be used in addition to opioids are needed. This case report provides the first evidence that entering an immersive virtual environment can serve as a powerful adjunctive, nonpharmacologic analgesic. Two patients received virtual reality VR, to distract them from high levels of pain during wound care. The first was a 16-year-old male with a deep flash burn on his right leg requiring surgery and staple placement. On two occasions, the patient spent some of his wound care in VR, and some playing a video game. On a 100 mm scale, he provided sensory and affective pain ratings, anxiety and subjective estimates of time spent thinking about his pain during the procedure. For the first session of wound care, these scores decreased 80 mm, 80 mm, 58 mm, and 93 mm, respectively, during VR treatment compared with the video game control condition. For the second session involving staple removal, scores also decreased. The second patient was a 17- year-old male with 33.5\% total body surface area deep hash bums on his face, neck, back, arms, hands and legs. He had difficulty tolerating wound care pain with traditional opioids alone and showed dramatic drops in pain ratings during VR compared to the video game (e.g, a 47 mm drop in pain intensity during wound care). We contend that VR is a uniquely attention- capturing medium capable of maximizing the amount of attention drawn away from the \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}real world\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, allowing patients to tolerate painful procedures. These preliminary results suggest that immersive VR merits more attention as a potentially viable form of treatment for acute pain.},

After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, 34 relevant articles were located and included in the study. Following the categorization scheme proposed by [Dempsey, J., Rasmussen, K., \& Lucassen, B. (1996). The instructional gaming literature: Implications and 99 sources. University of South Alabama, College of Education, Technical Report No. 96-1], those articles were grouped into the following four categories: (a) research, (b) development, (c) discussion and (d) theory. The overviewed articles suggest that electronic games present many potential benefits as educational tools for HE and PE, and that those games may improve young people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours in relation to health and physical exercise. Furthermore, the newly emerged physically interactive electronic games can potentially enhance young people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physical fitness, motor skills and motivation for physical exercise. The empirical evidence to support the educational effectiveness of electronic games in HE and PE is still rather limited, but the findings present a positive picture overall. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance to educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of HE and PE, and to electronic game designers. },

RL has commonly been used in competitive environments, in which the agent must perform as well as possible to beat its opponent. The innovative use of RL proposed here makes use of a challenge function, which estimates the current player\&\#39;s level, as well as changes on the action selection mechanism of the RL framework. The technique is applied to a fighting game, Knock\&\#39;em, to provide empirical validation of the approach.

They describe game characteristics and the key factors that make an activity or a game motivational and compelling, including fantasy and curiosity (Malone, 1980; Malone \&amp; Lepper, 1987; Myers, 1990, cited by Waal, 1995; Garris et al., 2002; Vockell, 2004). The terms fantasy and curiosity are then discussed and the implications of the use of fantasy in games are explained.

abstract = {In the current environment of digital games and immersive role play- ing systems, we often overlook previous methods of conveying and experienc- ing, interactive narrative-based entertainment. We present a fresh perspective on interactive digital storytelling systems based on table-top role playing games. Table-top games offer players the ability to negotiate and determine outcomes of a game with a referee. The nature of table-top gaming is such that players evolve, grow and maintain a rule set that represents an imaginary world. As such this form of gameplay provides a unique opportunity to study complex interactive storytelling structures under controlled circumstances. Using table- top role playing games as a model, we propose terminology and concepts that are different from the traditional literary or dramaturgical perspectives normally applied to interactive narrative systems.},

While content distribution over a wired network can be realized by instituting proxies and gateways at several parts of the access network, to provide mobility over heterogeneous wireless access we need to consider many operational issues such as handoff, join and leave latency, and desired QoS level for mobile clients. This article discusses some application layer techniques that help build a flexible mobile content distribution overlay type network supporting a multitiered payment and security scheme. The proposed streaming network, called MarconiNet, is based on standard.

There are few methods of assessing emotional state, and even fewer methods of quantifying emotion during play. This paper presents a novel method for continuously modeling emotion using physiological data. A fuzzy logic model transformed four physiological signals into arousal and valence. A second fuzzy logic model transformed arousal and valence into five emotional states relevant to computer game play: boredom, challenge, excitement, frustration, and fun. Modeled emotions compared favorably with a manual approach, and the means were also evaluated with subjective self-reports, exhibiting the same trends as reported emotions for fun, boredom, and excitement. This approach provides a method for quantifying emotional states continuously during a play experience.},

It is a freely downloadable package with a fast learning curve, which includes support for ad hoc networking and efficient graphics. We successfully deployed OpenTrek in a course at a local university. 28 students with no previous experience in Pocket PC programming were able to create 12 different advanced multiplayer networked games in only five weeks (which included introduction to the platform). By easing the development of advanced interactive applications on Pocket PC, OpenTrek can lower the hurdle for researchers who wish to prototype and test novel user interfaces for mobile devices.},

Recently, Mobile Broadband Wireless Access technology-based (MBWA) games have been introduced into the marketplace. They are superior to current mobile games in terms of transmission speed and price and to older online games that have limited mobility. Since MBWA technologies, such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Wireless Broadband (WiBro), and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) have been developed, customers can enjoy games whenever and wherever they like. We decided to analyze the factors that influence potential users\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} adoption of MBWA games using an extension of TAM. Most previous game-related studies lack a comprehensive approach to both technological and psychological aspects of game adoption and do not reflect a variety of consumer preferences. We therefore extended TAM to include an emotion variable and measured the moderating effects of gender, age, and prior experience on game adoption. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of perceived enjoyment was very important but that usefulness did not influence an individual\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s attitude. In addition, we also find that age can be key moderator of game acceptance.},

abstract = {Organizations continuously strive to engage customers in the services development process. The social web facilitates this process by enabling novel channels for voluntary feedback-sharing and collaborative interaction through social media and technologically advanced environments. The component parts of these environments are information systems that are linked with social media and designed for large displays to support interactivity. The work performed during this research involved the design and assessment of operational software features for encouraging user engagement through publicly displayed information systems. Drawing upon socio-psychological theories and interconnecting them to the seven social influence design principles listed in the Persuasive Systems Design model, this dissertation examines the role of persuasive software features in altering human behavior with respect to engagement in feedback-sharing and collaborative interaction. The dissertation consists of five quantitative studies, including one Twitter survey (involving 403 respondents) and four experiments with publicly displayed Twitter-based systems (involving 284 users), that successively complement each other to address the main research question: How can social influence design principles persuade people to engage with publicly displayed systems that are integrated with social media? The results of these studies reveal interplay between the design principles and indicate that they have the capacity to improve the persuasiveness of information systems and predict the behavioral intentions of users to engage with such systems in the future. Based on these findings, a framework for studying socially influencing systems (SIS) is proposed. This framework is potentially instrumental in achieving a richer understanding of how to effectively harness social influence for enhanced user engagement through socio-technical environments and for the future development of persuasive information systems},

abstract = {Selling virtual goods for real money is an increasingly popular revenue model for massively-multiplayer online games (MMOs), social networking sites (SNSs) and other online hangouts. In this paper, we argue that the marketing of virtual goods currently falls short of what it could be. Game developers have long created compelling game designs, but having to market virtual goods to players is a relatively new situation to them. Professional marketers, on the other hand, tend to overlook the internal design of games and hangouts and focus on marketing the services as a whole. To begin bridging the gap, we propose that the design patterns and game mechanics commonly used in games and online hangouts should be viewed as a set of marketing techniques designed to sell virtual goods. Based on a review of a number of MMOs, we describe some of the most common patterns and game mechanics and show how their effects can be explained in terms of analogous techniques from marketing science. The results provide a new perspective to game design with interesting implications to developers. Moreover, they also suggest a radically new perspective to marketers of ordinary goods and services: viewing marketing as a form of game design.},

This study explored the social interactions that occur both within and outside of MMORPGs. The sample consisted of 912 self-selected MMORPG players from 45 countries. MMORPGs were found to be highly socially interactive environments providing the opportunity to create strong friendships and emotional relationships. The study demonstrated that the social interactions in online gaming form a considerable element in the enjoyment of playing. The study showed MMORPGs can be extremely social games, with high percentages of gamers making life-long friends and partners. It was concluded that virtual gaming may allow players to express themselves in ways they may not feel comfortable doing in real life because of their appearance, gender, sexuality, and/or age. MMORPGs also offer a place where teamwork, encouragement, and fun can be experienced.

abstract = {The Interactive Fiction (IF) genre describes text-based narrative experiences in which a person interacts with a computer simulation by typing text phrases (usually commands in the imperative mood) and reading software-generated text responses (usually statements in the second person present tense). Re-examining historical and contemporary IF illuminates the larger fields of electronic literature and game studies. Intertwined aesthetic and technical developments in IF from 1977 to the present are analyzed in terms of language (person, tense, and mood), narrative theory (Iser’s gaps, the fabula / sjuzet distinction), game studies / ludology (player apprehension of rules, evaluation of strategic advancement), and filmic representation (subjective POV, time-loops). Two general methodological concepts for digital humanities analyses are developed in relation to IF: implied code, which facilitates studying the interactor’s mental model of an interactive work; and frustration aesthetics, which facilitates analysis of the constraints that structure interactive experiences. IF works interpreted in extended “close interactions” include Plotkin’s Shade (1999), Barlow’s Aisle (2000), Pontious’s Rematch (2000), Foster and Ravipinto’s Slouching Towards Bedlam (2003), and others.

abstract = {The majority of children in affluent countries now play electronic games, and this has lead to concerns about the health impact of this activity. Traditional electronic games have used gamepad, keyboard, and mouse input, but newer game interfaces that require more movement are now available. However the movement and muscle activity demands of electronic games have not been described. This study compared the amount of movement and muscle activity while 20 children aged 9 to 12 years watched a DVD and played games using handheld computer, gamepad, keyboard, steering wheel and, active-input (Webcam motion analysis-Sony EyeToy (R)) devices. Movement of the head, sacrum, foot, shoulder, wrist, and thumb was measured along with activity in cervical erector spinae, lumbar erector spinae, rectus femoris, upper trapezius, anterior deltoid, and wrist extensor muscles. Use of the wheel resulted in some increase in upper limb movement and muscle activity, but the other traditional input devices were usually as sedentary as watching a DVD. In contrast, use of the active-input device (EyeToy) resulted in substantial movement and muscle activity in limbs and torso. These results suggest that playing traditional electronic games is indeed a sedentary activity but that new active-input technologies may be useful in encouraging more movement and muscle activity in children.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate how playing a violent/nonviolent television game during the evening affects sympathetic and parasympathetic reactions during and after playing as well as sleep quality during the night after playing.Subjects and Methods: In total, 19 boys, 12-15 years of age, played television games on two occasions in their homes and participated once without gaming. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and physical activity were measured during gaming/participating and the night to follow using a portable combined heart rate and movement sensor. A sleep diary and questionnaires about gaming experiences and session-specific experiences were filled in.Criteria for Selection of Games: Violent game involves/rewards direct physical violence (no handguns) against another person, and nonviolent game involves/rewards no violence; same game design (\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}third-person game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}); conducted in the same manner; no differences concerning motor activity; similar sound and light effects; no sexual content, violence against women or racial overtones.Results: During violent (vs. nonviolent) gaming, there was significantly higher activity of the very low frequency component of the HRV and total power. During the night after playing, very low frequency, low frequency and high frequency components were significantly higher during the violent (vs. nonviolent) condition, just as total power. There were no significant differences between the three conditions (violent/nonviolent/no gaming) with respect to an index reflecting subjectively perceived sleep difficulties. Nor was there any difference between violent and nonviolent condition for any single sleep item.Conclusion: Violent gaming induces different autonomic responses in boys compared to nonviolent gaming - during playing and during the following night - suggesting different emotional responses. Subjectively perceived sleep quality is not influenced after a single gaming experience. Future studies should address the development of the autonomic balance after gaming over longer time than a night, physiological adaptation to frequent gaming and potential gender differences.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the relationships between the time spent on sedentary activities (computer usage, video game playing, television viewing, and reading) and physical inactivity in a sample of youth (aged 12-19 years) from the 2000-2001 Canadian Community Health Survey. Methods: The study sample included 7982 youth (4034 males, 3948 females) across Canada (mean age: 15.61 years, SD: 2.23 years). Weekly time spent on computers, video games, television, and reading during leisure-time was obtained through self-reported questionnaires. Physical inactivity was determined by respondents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} daily energy expenditure assessed through a physical activity questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between sedentary activities and physical inactivity respectively by gender. Sociodemographic variables, health status, and overweight status were controlled in the analysis. Results: A substantial proportion of Canadian youth was inactive: 50.3\% of males and 67.8\% of females. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, health status, and body mass index, television viewing was significantly associated with physical inactivity for both males and females regardless of their overweight status. However, computer usage was associated with physical activity among males, and reading was associated with physical activity among females. Conclusions: There is a complex inter-relationship between sedentary behaviors and physical inactivity, highlighting the need for targeted interventions addressing patterns of sedentary behavior engagement. Reducing time spent on television viewing may be one plausible strategy within such interventions in reducing physical inactivity among youth.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first results of an empirical study of how players interpret the role of the player and the relationship between the player and playable figures in gameworlds. In the following, we will see examples of four genres that situate the player in different positions with
respect to the gameworld. Command \& Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars illustrates a game where the player does not have a playable figure in the gameworld, while Crysis exemplifies a game where player and playable figure viewpoints merge into one entity. Diablo 2 represents a game
with a developing figure, and The Sims 2 demonstrates a hybrid combination of named, developing figures controlled by the player from a god perspective. The study shows that players tend to accept all features that aid them in understanding how to play the game, and that it does not matter whether features have a stylistic or naturalistic relationship to the gameworld. Regarding the relationship between player and playable figure, the respondents do not see the dual position of the player situated in the physical world while having the power to act within the gameworld as a paradox, but a necessary way of communication in games. },

No. Computer games are art-a popular art, an emerging art, a largely unrecognized art, but art nevertheless.

Experimental results showed that those exposed to a violent and hypermasculine television program had a larger increase in reports of aggression and hostility compared to those exposed to a nonviolent, hypermasculine television program. Self-reports of higher levels of hypermasculinity prior to exposure led to larger increases in aggression and hostility after exposure. Predicted interactions between exposure to the stimulus and prior hypermasculinity occurred for many of the aggression/hostility dimensions.

abstract = {There is a large disparity between the rich physical interfaces of co-located arcade games and the generic input devices seen in most home console systems. In this article we argue that a digital table is a conducive form factor for general co-located home gaming as it affords: (a) seating in collaboratively relevant positions that give all equal opportunity to reach into the surface and share a common view; (b) rich whole-handed gesture input usually seen only when handling physical objects; (c) the ability to monitor how others use space and access objects on the surface; and (d) the ability to communicate with each other and interact on top of the surface via gestures and verbal utterance. Our thesis is that multimodal gesture and speech input benefits collaborative interaction over such a digital table. To investigate this thesis, we designed a multimodal, multiplayer gaming environment that allows players to interact directly atop a digital table via speech and rich whole-hand gestures. We transform two commercial single-player computer games, representing a strategy and simulation game genre, to work within this setting.

abstract = {Tens of millions of people today are living part of their life in a virtual world. In places like World of Warcraft, Second Life, and Free Realms, people are making friends, building communities, creating art, and making real money. Business is booming on the virtual frontier, as billions of dollars are paid in exchange for pixels on screens. But sometimes things go wrong. Virtual criminals defraud online communities in pursuit of real-world profits. People feel cheated when their avatars lose virtual property to wrongdoers. Increasingly, they turn to legal systems for solutions. But when your avatar has been robbed, what law is there to assist you?

In Virtual Justice, Greg Lastowka illustrates the real legal dilemmas posed by virtual worlds. Presenting the most recent lawsuits and controversies, he explains how governments are responding to the chaos on the cyberspace frontier. After an engaging overview of the history and business models of today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s virtual worlds, he explores how laws of property, jurisdiction, crime, and copyright are being adapted to pave the path of virtual law.

Virtual worlds are becoming more important to society with each passing year. This pioneering study will be an invaluable guide to scholars of online communities for years to come. },

Special mention is made of seizures induced by the television screen, computer screen and video-games. The palpebral myoclonias with absences may be considered to be reflex seizures, since they are induced by eyelid closure, and include the vary rare self-induced epileptic seizures.

While some simulators can produce strong vibro-tactile sensations, the discrimination of several tactile patterns remains quite poor. Skin sensitivity is not enough for remembering and recognizing vibration patterns (tactons) and their combinations. Short-term tactile memory is the crucial factor in educational and vocational environments for deaf and blind people. We designed a vibro-tactile pen and software to create tactons and semantic sequences of vibro-tactile patterns on mobile devices (iPAQ pocket PC). We propose special games to facilitate learning and manipulation by tactons. The techniques are based on gesture recognition and spatial-temporal mapping for imaging vibro-tactile signals. The proposed approach and the tools implemented allow creating a new kind of mobile communication environment for deaf and blind people.},

Recently, large collections of motion capture data have been exploited for increased realism in avatar animation and control. Large motion sets have the advantage of accommodating a broad variety of natural human motion. However, when a motion set is large, the time required to identify an appropriate sequence of motions is the bottleneck for achieving interactive avatar control. In this paper, we present a novel method of precomputing avatar behavior from Unlabeled motion data in order to animate and control avatars at minimal runtime cost. Based on dynamic programming, our method finds a control policy that indicates how the avatar should act in any given situation. We demonstrate the effectiveness Of our approach through examples that include avatars interacting with each other and with the User. },

abstract = {The increasingly social nature of gaming suggests the importance of understanding its affective and psychological outcomes. The current research examined the influence of social motivations and gaming contexts on dimensions of psychological well-being. It also aimed to examine the influence of social factors on gaming experiences. The programme of research consisted of two separate studies using different methodologies in which a total of 327 videogamers participated. The results revealed that social motivations predicted flow in gaming, and that some social motivations and social contexts were predictive of dimensions of psychological well-being. Qualitative analysis revealed the importance of social connectedness and belonging for game enjoyment, and suggested these are key factors which keep gamers playing. Social interactions and networking during gameplay also had an important influence on game enjoyment. Social experiences could also facilitate feelings of frustration in gameplay due to poor social dynamics and competitiveness with other players. These findings demonstrate the importance of social experiences and their influences on the outcomes of gaming. Future research is needed to examine the role of competitiveness in the dynamics of online and offline social gaming contexts, as well as gaming experiences and outcomes. Research examining the differences between gaming experiences for both solo and multiplayer gaming is also warranted. },

To that end, we describe a practical approach to real-time learning for synthetic characters. Our implementation is grounded in the techniques of reinforcement learning and informed by insights from animal training. It simplifies the teaming task for characters by (a) enabling them to take advantage of predictable regularities in their world, (b) allowing them to make maximal use of any supervisory signals, and (c) making them easy to train by humans. We built an autonomous animated dog that can be trained with a technique used to train real dogs called "clicker training". Capabilities demonstrated include being trained to recognize and use acoustic patterns as cues for actions, as well as to synthesize new actions from novel paths through its motion space. A key contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that by addressing the three problems of state, action, and state-action space discovery at the same time, the solution for each becomes easier. Finally, we articulate heuristics and design principles that make learning practical for synthetic characters.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Interactive synthetic environments are currently used in a wide
variety of applications, including video games, exposure therapy,
education, and training. Their success in such domains relies on
their immersive and engagement qualities. Filmmakers and
theatre directors use many techniques to project tension in the
hope of affecting audiences\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} affective states. These techniques
include narrative, sound effects, camera movements, and lighting.
This paper focuses on temporal variation of lighting color and its
use in evoking tension within interactive virtual worlds. Many
game titles adopt some cinematic lighting effects to evoke certain
moods, particularly saturated red colored lighting, flickering
lights, and very dark lighting. Such effects may result in user
frustration due to the lack of balance between the desire to project
tension and the desire to use lighting for other goals, such as
visibility and depth projection. In addition, many of the lighting
effects used in game titles are very obvious and obtrusive. In this
paper, the author will identify several lighting color patterns, both
obtrusive and subtle, based on a qualitative study of several
movies and lighting design theories. In addition to identifying
these patterns, the author also presents a system that dynamically
modulates the lighting within an interactive environment to
project the desired tension while balancing other lighting goals,
such as establishing visibility, projecting depth, and providing
motivation for lighting direction. This work extends the author\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s
previous work on the Expressive Lighting Engine [1-3]. Results
of incorporating this system within a game will be discussed.},

A number of legitimate interests on part of both producers and gamers may be readily distinguished.

This study uses multilevel modeling to examine individual growth curves in aggressiveness and violent media use. The measure of use of media violence included viewing action films, playing violent computer and video games, and visiting violence-oriented Internet sites by students from 20 middle schools in 10 different regions in the United States. The findings appear largely consistent with the proposed model. In particular, concurrent effects of aggressiveness on violent-media use and concurrent and lagged effects of violent media use on aggressiveness were found. The implications of this model for theorizing about media effects on youth, and for bridging active audience with media effects perspectives, are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent advances in computer graphics, particularly in real-time rendering, have caused major improvements in 3D graphics and rendering techniques used in interactive entertainment. In this paper, we focus on the scene lighting process, which we define as the process of configuring the number of lights used in a scene, their properties (e.g. range and attenuation), positions, angles, and colors. Lighting design is well known among designers, directors, and visual artists for its vital role in influencing viewers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} perception by evoking moods, directing their gaze to important areas (i.e. providing visual focus), and conveying visual tension. It is, however, difficult to set positions, angles, or colors for lights within interactive scenes to accommodate these design goals, because an interactive scene\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s spatial and dramatic configuration, including mood, dramatic intensity, and the relative importance of different characters, change unpredictably in real-time. There are several techniques developed by the game industry that establish spectacular real-time lighting effects within 3-D interactive environments. These techniques are often time and labor intensive. In addition, they are not easily used to dynamically mold the visual design to convey communicative, dramatic, and aesthetic functions as addressed in creative disciplines, such as art, film, and theatre. In this paper, we present a new real-time lighting design model based on cinematic and theatric lighting design theory. The proposed model is designed to automatically, and in real-time, adjust lighting in an interactive scene accommodating the dramatic, aesthetic, and communicative functions described by traditional lighting design theories while accommodating artistic constraints concerning style, visual continuity, and aesthetic function.},

Subjects had at least five 15-minute exposures to a breath biofeedback game that challenged them to track a moving target using their breath. Subjects reacted positively to the breath tracking challenge. Repeated-measures analysis of variance of a tracking fidelity statistic showed improvement in eye--breath coordination over 5 sessions ( P = .026). It was concluded that an electronic breath game is safe and can improve breath awareness among children with CF.

Made popular as a concept by Henry Jenkins (2006), transmedial storytelling is the creation of a storyworld through multiple documents belonging to various media. The three fundamental operations of transfictionality—expansion, modification, and transposition—are investigated in terms of their potential for transmedial storytelling. After an analysis of the variety of documents that make up the storyworld of Alpha 0.7 (S\"{u}dwestrundfunk 2010), a German transmedial story system that comprises a TV miniseries, radio plays, fictional web pages, and links to nonfictional texts created independently of the project, the article asks under which conditions an alternate reality game (ARG) could be added to the system without spoiling the experience of those people who limit their exploration of the storyworld to watching the TV show. In turn, the last section asks what kind of stories lend themselves to transmedial projects and why such projects are currently popular.},

Research Methods and Procedures: The study population was drawn from the 1997 China Health National Survey (1385 children, ages 6 to 11 years), conducted with a representative sample from nine provinces. The 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BMI charts were used to calculate "at risk of overweight" as those above the 85th percentile. Three days of 24-hour recall dietary data and detailed questions on physical activity and inactivity for the previous 7 days were used. Results: 9.4\% of the children were classified as overweight. Weekly mean and range of hours spent watching television/ videos, playing video games, studying, and in inactive transport were 5.1 (0 to 35), 0.3 (0 to 10), 4.7 (0 to 60), and 0.14 (0 to 4.2), respectively. Television/video viewing and studying did not differ in any meaningful manner between overweight and normal weight children. Snacking is inconsequential in China, comprising only 0.9\% of energy intake. Discussion: Chinese children are less overweight, less inactive, and less likely to ingest calories as snacks than children in the U.S. The absence of impact of these measures of inactivity, which are below an hour per day for the average Chinese child, indicate the possible value of limiting television viewing and other types of inactivity in other countries. Modern Western-style television programming and advertising started to come to China after 1997; therefore, extensive changes in television viewing patterns are expected to emerge.},

It is hypothesised that low empathy and attitudes that predispose people towards violence are more strongly related to exposure to violent films and computer games than to superordinate personality traits (e.g., EPQ psychoticism, extraversion, antisocial personality traits), or subtraits, such as sensation-seeking. Four hundred and thirty-three students in further education completed three personality questionnaires, a questionnaire of attitudes towards violence, and reported on their use of violent computer games, films and videos. Multivariate analyses in the form of ordinary least squares (OLS) models were used to test the primary hypotheses. Acceptance of violence, as measured by the Maudsley Violence Questionnaire (MVQ), was the strongest and most consistent predictor of violent media use. Superordinate personality traits were generally fully mediated by acceptance of violence. The findings emphasise the importance of general acceptance of violence in the consumption of violent games and films. Some gender differences emerged; particularly in relation to the use of violent computer games. Empathy had no significant effects for either males or females.},

Setting: Four Chicago public schools in the US. Subjects: Over 450 5 - 7th graders and their families and schools were involved. Results: Our baseline data indicate a high prevalence of overweight (43\% in boys and 41\% in girls) and a number of problems in these children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physical activity and eating patterns. Only 26\% reported spending >= 20 min engaged in vigorous-moderate exercise in >= 5 days over the past 7 days; 29\% reported spending >= 5 h each day watching TV, playing video games, or using computer. They also consumed too many fried foods and soft drinks. On average, 55\% consumed fried foods >= 2 times/day over the past 7 days; regarding soft drinks, 70\% reported consuming >= 2 times/day. Conclusion: School-based obesity prevention programs are urgently needed in the target US urban, low SES, minority communities. These data can be used to inform intervention activities.},

In this view, games are special (magical) and they only come to life within temporal and spatial borders that are enacted and performed by the participants. This article discusses the concept of a \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}magic circle\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and finds that it lacks specificity. Attempts to use the concept of a magic circle create a number of anomalies that are problematic. This is not, as has been suggested earlier, primarily a matter of the genre of the game, or a discussion of what an appropriate definition of a \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} might be. Rather, in this study with hardcore gamers, playing computer games is a routine and mundane activity, making the boundary between play and non-play tenuous to say the least. This article presents an alternative theoretical framework which should be explored further.},

abstract = {The main objective of this thesis is to enrich computer science education by studying two gameful teaching interventions: 1) achievement badges and 2) alternate reality games. Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, and achievement badges are one commonly used gamification method that can be used to provide optional challenges for students. We studied the use of achievement badges in a Data Structures and Algorithms course and found out that badges can be used to steer students' behavior even if they are not tied to tangible rewards such as course grades. Specifically, students used more time in the online learning environment, had more sessions in the system, and spent more time between exercise submissions when the badges were used. Furthermore, we found out that students' attitudes towards the badges varied. We also studied the use of badges in relation to achievement goal orientations that characterize students' preferences to different goals and outcomes. We found out that students who had high avoidance orientation were less motivated by the badges than other students. On the other hand, students who were the most motivated by the badges had higher mastery-intrinsic, mastery-extrinsic, and performance-approach orientations, and lower avoidance orientation. Furthermore, we compared the badge intervention with the use of heatmaps that provided feedback on one's behavior in a non- gameful way. An interest towards the badges correlated with mastery-extrinsic and performance-approach, whereas interest towards the heatmaps correlated with mastery- extrinsic and performance-avoidance orientations. Alternate Reality Games (ARG), are games that blur the line between reality and fiction and typically they involve puzzles and an interactive narrative. We explored the use of ARGs for teaching computer science by organizing an ARG covering a wide range of computer science concepts. In the feedback collected after the game, participants reported learning several computer science concepts during the game. We also evaluated how authenticity, intrinsic motivation, and replayability were taken into account in the game design. Furthermore, we present an example of an educational ARG that was not part of any official curriculum and relied on voluntary participation. Based on the results, alternate reality games seem like a promising approach to be used in computer science education. In addition to evaluating the two approaches, we provide support for applying them in education by describing the implementation of our badge systems and introducing a method for producing automatically assessed programming tasks that are suitable for ARGs.},

Interactivity in the form of natural mapping has been advocated as a possible contributor to presence experiences, yet few studies to date have investigated this potential. The present work formulates a preliminary typology of natural mapping and addresses how several types of mapping impact the experience of a video game, with the expectation that more natural mapping leads to increased spatial presence affecting enjoyment. Two studies were conducted. In the first study, 48 participants played a golfing video game using one of two controller types (Nintendo Wiimote or gamepad). In the second, 78 participants played a driving video game using an even more natural controller (steering wheel) or one of three other controller types. Participants then completed measures of perceived naturalness, presence, and enjoyment. Results of both studies were generally consistent with expectations. },

abstract = {Extensive literature has shown that games can provide an engaging, dynamic, and authentic learning context. Many of the studies on the use of games in education indicate that games can support teaching standards and outcomes; however, they do not describe actual uses of video games for learning. Through the analysis of affordances employed by student gamers, an understanding of how learning takes place can inform the design of effective educational games and aid their integration into contemporary classrooms. Informed by ethnomethodology, this study used methods of grounded theory provided a detailed description of the use of video games for learning in educational contexts. Results demonstrate that learning occurs across multiple levels: the mastery of the computer interface, followed by the mastery of the game interface and upon which students can achieve advanced strategy aimed at goal achievement. Learning also occurs across multiple granularities: occurring either in short episodes, sequences of episodes, or trends. Learning can be triggered by multiple cues, such as failure, game visualizations or specific representations, as well as by peers or teachers in the social environment. Students used affordances provided by the game interface and learning environment, specifically: the visual representations of games afford particular actions; the persistent display of historical context as well as present and future potentials motivates learning; specific cues can grab attention, helping to focus efforts on new or underutilized game tasks; consistent and well organized visualizations encourage learning; and information presented in a plurality of channels is most effective for learning. The use of social peers in collaborative learning had several effects on the learning process: peers disclosed information to achieve shared meaning of objects\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} purposes, and negotiated to collaboratively choose game strategies. Peer teams served cooperative roles as information sources and competitively as a performance gauge. Implications for students, educators, and game designers are offered to better play, implement, and design games for learning. A brief comparison of findings with existing theory discusses similarities among collaborative learning and activity theory, and suggests opportunities for future work. Overall, findings indicate a great potential for the use of games in education for learning.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that movement primitives can also be applied to the problem of implementing lifelike computer game characters. We present an approach to behavior modeling and learning that integrates several pattern recognition and machine learning techniques: trained with data from recorded multiplayer computer games, neural gas networks learn topological representation of virtual worlds; PCA is used to identify elementary movements the human players repeatedly executed during a match and complex behaviors are represented as probability functions mapping movement primitives to locations in the game environment. Experimental results underline that this framework produces game characters with humanlike skills.},

abstract = {We analyse a randomized pursuit-evasion game played by two players on a graph, a hunter and a rabbit. Let G be any connected, undirected graph with n nodes. The game is played in rounds and in each round both the hunter and the rabbit are located at a node of the graph. Between rounds both the hunter and the rabbit can stay at the current node or move to another node. The hunter is assumed to be restricted to the graph G: in every round, the hunter can move using at most one edge. For the rabbit we investigate two models: in one model the rabbit is restricted to the same graph as the hunter, and in the other model the rabbit is unrestricted, i.e., it can jump to an arbitrary node in every round. We say that the rabbit is caught as soon as hunter and rabbit are located at the same node in a round. The goal of the hunter is to catch the rabbit in as few rounds as possible, whereas the rabbit aims to maximize the number of rounds until it is caught. Given a randomized hunter strategy for G, the escape length for that strategy is the worst case expected number of rounds it takes the hunter to catch the rabbit, where the worst case is with regard to all (possibly randomized) rabbit strategies. Our main result is a hunter strategy for general graphs with an escape length of only O(n log(diam(G))) against restricted as well as unrestricted rabbits. This bound is close to optimal since Omega(n) is a trivial lower bound on the escape length in both models. Furthermore, we prove that our upper bound is optimal up to constant factors against unrestricted rabbits.},

Our findings are compared against a real world drug trafficking network and suggest similarities in both organizations\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} network structures reflect similar effects of secrecy, resilience, and efficiency.},

abstract = {Purpose: We evaluated a new noninvasive outpatient method of pelvic muscle retraining in children using computer game assisted biofeedback. Materials and Methods: All patients in whom voiding dysfunction was confirmed by history, uroflowmetry-electromyography and voiding cystourethrography were enrolled in a pelvic floor muscle retraining program. Patients received a pretreatment, mid treatment and posttreatment survey instrument documenting subjective improvement, including the frequency of diurnal enuresis, nocturnal enuresis, constipation and encopresis. Pretreatment and posttreatment simultaneous uroflowmetry surface electrode electromyography was performed and post-void residual urine volume was determined in all patients. Results: A total of 8 boys and 33 girls 5 to 11 years old (mean age 7.2) completed therapy and were available for evaluation. These patients completed 2 to 11 (average 6) hourly treatment sessions. Followup was 3 to 15 months (average 7). At the midterm evaluation improvement in nocturnal enuresis was reported by 57\% of the patients, diurnal enuresis by 84\%, constipation by 83\% and encopresis by 91\%. End treatment evaluation revealed improvement in nocturnal enuresis by 90\% of patients, diurnal enuresis by 89\%, constipation by 100\% and encopresis by 100\%. Uroflowmetry-electromyography patterns improved in 42\% of the patients and post-void residual urine decreased in 57\%. Comparison of initial to end recorded millivoltage pelvic floor muscle values demonstrated that 56\% of the patients had lower resting tone at the beginning of the session after completing therapy and 78\% had improved contracting tone after performing Kegel exercises, as proved by increased microvoltage values. Initial uroflowmetry-electromyography revealed certain categories of cases, including a flattened voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and low post-void residual urine in 40\%, a flattened voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and high post-void residual-urine in 40\%, a staccato voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and low post-void residual urine in 3\%, and a staccato voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and high post-void residual urine in 17\%. Of the girls 91\% presented with the classic spinning top deformity on voiding cystourethrography. A total of 22 patients presented with a significant history of recurrent urinary tract infections, and infection developed in 3 during treatment and followup. Vesicoureteral reflux in 14 patients resolved during treatment in 3, reimplantation was performed in 1 and 10 are still being observed. Conclusions: A program of conservative medical management with computer game assisted pelvic floor muscle retraining resulted in significant subjective improvement in continence, constipation and encopresis as well as objective improvement in uroflowmetry-electromyography, post-void residual urine volume and the microvoltage value of pelvic floor muscles in the majority of patients with dysfunctional voiding.},

to introduce middle school and high school female students to IT and assist them in acquiring five basic IT skills. During the
course, survey data was collected from participating students. Results from the surveys as well as analysis of student projects

abstract = {A complete system for path and route finding through arbitrary complex three-dimensional (313) polygonal worlds is presented. The system is fully automated and can quickly map a complete digital environment without the need for human intervention. Arbitrary complex polygonal worlds can be processed within a few minutes on today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s computers. The processed information allows a robot with a limited number of degrees of freedom to efficiently navigate around obstacles and find routes through the environment. The system is especially suitable for route finding and navigation through buildings which are typically designed with the use of computers these days. As such, digital polygonal representations of buildings are readily available. Not only can the system be used for robot navigation, it can also be used to guide people through buildings. Being able to quickly compile an arbitrary building into a route and path finding system can be especially useful for firemen and tactical military units to invade buildings and reach specific locations. When a building is partly destroyed or inaccessible for other reasons, the digital representation of the building can easily be adjusted by adding or removing polygons and the system presented here can be used to quickly recalculate routes. The system has been successfully implemented and employed in the popular computer game Quake III Arena. The artificial players in this game use the system for path and route finding through complex 31) polygonal worlds. Many other computer games can also benefit from the system presented here.},

A principal dynamic of these processes concerns the opposition between \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}ludological\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and narratological theorisations of the computer game. This opposition is examined for both its limitations and its productive potential by means of consideration of the thing game and its relation to john carpenter\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s cinematic iteration of the original short story from which it is adapted. This consideration leads away from the question of the specificity of the computer game object to some concluding speculations about the relation of contemporary computer games to the broader computer culture within which games are taking on an increasingly significant profile.},

Spectatorial and institutional approaches are rejected on the grounds that they do not speak to the unique qualities of the video game medium. Dewey’s aesthetic theory gives a central place to interactivity and embodiment, critical elements of video games.

abstract = {This report describes the theoretical framework based on previous work and the results draw attention to existing issues in gender and games. One of the problems found in current studies is the tendency of games to be on either extreme end of the design styles. Many popular games are designed for the male players in mind and deter female players due to somewhat excessive masculine design e.g. violence and hyper-sexualized characters. Although there are some efforts in designing games for the female market, these custom-made games were too feminized e.g. wedding theme; shopping; and in pink colour, which consequently exclude the male players. Designing a gender-neutral game is important to ensure that both genders are learning as well as the other. The proposed study aims to design a model for gender-inclusivity in games. It will be based on a critical analysis of current game design models and finding principles that represent the composition of a game design model. Based on this, gender-inclusive elements will be incorporated and a new model will be proposed. The model will help determine whether a game is gender-specific, which contains extreme elements of either gender, or gender-inclusive, contains elements that might appeal to both male and female players. The model will be implemented through a series of game experiments and the results will used to improve the model, consequently contribute to the game design theory.},

abstract = {Purpose. This study examined the prevalence rate of astigmatism and its epidemiological risk factors in Singapore school children. Methods. In a study of school children aged 7 to 9 years old in two schools in Singapore in 1999, a detailed questionnaire was administered to parents regarding reading or close-work habits, past history of close-work, family history, and socioeconomic factors. Cycloplegic refraction was performed five times in each eye. Defining astigmatism as worse than or equal to 0.5, 0.75, and 1 D cylinder in the right eye, the prevalence of astigmatism was calculated. Results. The study population consisted of 1028 children. The prevalence rate of astigmatism (worse than or equal to 1 D cylinder) was 19.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 16.8 to 21.6). This was not different between genders, ethnic groups, or age (p > 0.05). With-the-rule astigmatism was more common than against-the-rule astigmatism. The prevalence of astigmatism and myopia was 9.8\% (95\% confidence interval, 8.0 to 11.6). A high AC/A ratio was associated (p = 0.003) with astigmatism, even after exclusion of myopic children. On vectorial analysis, J(0) and J(45) were associated with the number of hours of playing video games, whereas J(45) was also associated with computer use. Only J(45) was associated to male gender, a high AC/A ratio, and a family history of myopia. Conclusions. The prevalence rate of astigmatism (greater than or equal to1 D) was 19\%. Playing video games and computer use may be associated with astigmatism severity, although the presence of astigmatism (greater than or equal to1 D) was not associated with any nearwork factors. A family history of myopia was associated with oblique astigmatism severity. A high AC/A ratio is associated with astigmatism, and this requires further investigation.},

Native Dutch and immigrant children worked with the software 15 min/week during one school year. Following a pretest - interim test - post-test - retention test design, the effects on rhyming, phonemic segmentation, auditory blending, and grapheme knowledge were assessed. The intervention showed significant immediate effects on rhyming and grapheme knowledge. The time spent on the computer games also correlated with the learning gains for the experimental group. In the first grade, retention effects were demonstrated after 4 months of formal reading education.},

abstract = {This study develops the premise that "the commons" is today emerging as a crucial concept for activists and thinkers involved in myriad mobilizations around the planet. This follows from a shared experience of "enclosure" - the dispossession, expropriation and fencing-in effected, across a wide variety of economic, social and psychological registers, by the forces of a globally triumphant world-market. A case study connects two aspects of this process. The first is the binding of minds and imaginations in the information spaces dominated by media corporations, using the example of Nintendo, a leading company in the video game business. The second facet of the contemporary enclosures is the incarceration of laboring bodies of dispossessed peasants and subsistence providers in the factory-spaces of the new planetary industrial zones. The specific case involves an assembly plant operated by a Nintendo subcontractor, Maxi-Switch, in the Mexican maquiladoras, where the destruction of a pre-capitalist peasant agriculture has created a labor force available for re-enclosure and multinational exploitation in the "postmodern Satanic Mills" of globalized capital.},

In this course, the students are required to implement a small-to-medium scale interactive computer game in one semester, making use of a game framework. The students begin with a small number of the most tangible objects of an immediate concern. Then, as the semester unfolds and the game becomes increasingly sophisticated, OOP principles and design patterns are introduced as the means to cope with design complexity. The experience has indicated that framework-assisted, computer-game programming is a highly effective way to keep the learners engaged and facilitated in broadening and deepening their OOP skills. The ability to design nontrivial computer games that actually work has induced a consistently high level of sense of achievement among the students.

This paper overviews these two innovative data collection methods and examines both the advantages (e.g., ease of data collection; rich and complex resource of textual material that can be revisited after the event; targeting specific and/or diverse populations; participant anonymity; participant convenience; increased honesty, etc.) and disadvantages (e.g., lack of contextual data; sampling bias; lack of researcher control, lack of knowledge about participant behaviour, generalizability) to aid those researchers working in the online gaming studies field. This paper extends upon previous methodological papers in the area by outlining some of the methodological and ethical issues associated with these two specific online methodologies. Although online data collection may raise concerns about the research participants’ integrity and the quality of the data collected, it is concluded that the use of online forums and online solicited diary blogging can provide new insights unavailable to other data collection methods for those working in the gaming studies field},

By replicating an earlier usability study, in which the participants utilised security tools to send and receive encrypted emails, the practical consequences of learning via a Game-Based Instruction were evaluated; the findings show that none of the participants who were given the chosen computer game as an instruction before the actual assignment did make any serious error when applying their security knowledge in contrast to the participants who did not receive any instruction in forehand. They also finished the assignment faster than the corresponding participants. To be able to evaluate the "practical knowledge" acquired, a model for Vital Security Functions was created that allows for comparison of security usage between high-level security applications. },

This study investigates if \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}uncanniness\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} is increased for a character with a perceived lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face. More important, our study also investigates if the magnitude of this increased uncanniness varies depending on which emotion is being communicated. Individual parameters for each facial muscle in a 3D model were controlled for the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise in addition to a neutral expression. The results indicate that even fully and expertly animated characters are rated as more uncanny than humans and that, in virtual characters, a lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face during speech exaggerates the uncanny by inhibiting effective communication of the perceived emotion, significantly so for fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise but not for anger and happiness. Based on our results, we consider the implications for virtual character design.},

abstract = {Past self-organizing models of collectively moving "particles" (simulated bird flocks, fish schools, etc.) have typically been based on purely reflexive agents that have no significant memory of past movements. We hypothesized that giving such individual particles a limited distributed memory of past obstacles they encountered could lead to significantly faster travel between goal destinations. Systematic computational experiments using six terrains that had different arrangements of obstacles demonstrated that, at least in some domains, this conjecture is true. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrated that improved performance over time came not only from the avoidance of previously seen obstacles, but also (surprisingly) immediately after first encountering obstacles due to decreased delays in circumventing those obstacles. Simulations also showed that, of the four strategies we tested for removal of remembered obstacles when memory was full and a new obstacle was to be saved, none was better than random selection. These results may be useful in interpreting future experimental research on group movements in biological populations, and in improving existing methodologies for control of collective movements in computer graphics, robotic teams, particle swarm optimization, and computer games.},

abstract = {Background Due to improved ergonomics and dexterity, robotic surgery is promoted as being easily performed by surgeons with no special skills necessary. We tested this hypothesis by measuring IQ elements, computer gaming skills, general dexterity with chopsticks, and evaluating laparoscopic experience in correlation to performance ability with the da Vinci (R) robot.Methods Thirty-four individuals were tested for robotic dexterity, IQ elements, computer-gaming skills and general dexterity. Eighteen surgically inexperienced and 16 laparoscopically trained surgeons were included. Each individual performed three different tasks with the da Vinci surgical system and their times were recorded. An IQ test (elements: logical thinking, 3D imagination and technical understanding) was completed by each participant. Computer skills were tested with a simple computer game (hand-eye coordination) and general dexterity was evaluated by the ability to use chopsticks.Results We found no correlation between logical thinking, 3D imagination and robotic skills. Both computer gaming and general dexterity showed a slight but non-significant improvement in performance with the da Vinci robot (p > 0.05). A significant correlation between robotic skills, technical understanding and laparoscopic experience was observed (p < 0.05).Conclusions The data support the conclusion that there are no significant correlations between robotic performance and logical thinking, 3D understanding, computer gaming skills and general dexterity. A correlation between robotic skills and technical understanding may exist. Laparoscopic experience seems to be the strongest predictor of performance with the da Vinci surgical system. Generally, it appears difficult to determine non-surgical predictors for robotic surgery. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Both types of rationality play an important role in policy processes. Yet, although the difference is straightforward in theory, and is addressed and well-illustrated in most standard textbooks on public administration, students seem to have difficulty internalizing it. This article reports on our findings from a role-playing game designed to make students experience the difference between policy making as a process of rational design and policy making as a process of political negotiation. We conducted an experiment involving a large group of students enrolled in a first year, one-semester course, and a control group of students who enrolled in the same course 1 year later. The former were tested four times (start of the course, immediately before and after playing the game, and 3 months later) and the latter two times (at the start of the course and at the exam) for their understanding of how policy making\{$\backslash$textemdash\}as-rational-design and policy making\{$\backslash$textemdash\}as-political-negotiation differ on seven characteristics.

The residents of Second Life create communities, buy property and build homes, go to concerts, meet in bars, attend weddings and religious services, buy and sell virtual goods and services, find friendship, fall in love--the possibilities are endless, and all encountered through a computer screen. Coming of Age in Second Life is the first book of anthropology to examine this thriving alternate universe.

Tom Boellstorff conducted more than two years of fieldwork in Second Life, living among and observing its residents in exactly the same way anthropologists traditionally have done to learn about cultures and social groups in the so-called real world. He conducted his research as the avatar "Tom Bukowski," and applied the rigorous methods of anthropology to study many facets of this new frontier of human life, including issues of gender, race, sex, money, conflict and antisocial behavior, the construction of place and time, and the interplay of self and group.

Coming of Age in Second Life shows how virtual worlds can change ideas about identity and society. Bringing anthropology into territory never before studied, this book demonstrates that in some ways humans have always been virtual, and that virtual worlds in all their rich complexity build upon a human capacity for culture that is as old as humanity itself.},

abstract = {Research driving the mandates of the current education reform law, No Child Left Behind, indicates a 300\% increase during the last 10 years in students being labeled with specific learning disabilities. In addition there has been a dramatic increase in the number of minority students labeled as having learning and emotional disabilities (U.S. Department of Education, 2002). One possible reason for this disturbing evidence is that our teachers and schools are not prepared to assess the skills or meet the needs of a new generation of learners entering their classrooms. The new generation the author is referring to are those students who have daily access to interactive 3D environments, spend a significant amount of time exploring that environment and have the skills to maneuver and problem-solve within it. These environments are the 3D worlds of video games. There is evidence indicating the same students who are most at risk for failure in the traditional classroom setting also spend an average of twenty-seven minutes per day more than their counterparts using video games. The author of this article asserts that the use of video games as a teaching tool deserves serious consideration as a means of presenting information and bridging learning concepts. She argues that exploring the use of video games in the classroom forces educators to reevaluate their role as \&\#39;teacher\&\#39;. Video games allow teachers to share learning experiences with the students and to label and extend the student\&\#39;s learning in such a way as to truly prepare the child for future challenges. The author recommends today\&\#39;s teachers, and especially those just entering the profession, partner with the students and get on board--the students are already there.

They would be collaborators in the same imaginative space, and working as equals, they'd create a new medium, together. That announcement was made, if you listened closely enough, at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Jose, when Valve Software founder Gabe Newell unveiled Steam, a broadband distribution network that would offer instant updates to recent Valve games and new titles from Valve and other companies. Listed among the new titles was "Day of Defeat," a multiplayer add-on to Valve's best-selling first-person shooter (FPS), "Half-Life."},

This study aims at comparing laparoscopic virtual reality (VR) task performance of children with different levels of experience in video games and residents. Participants and methods: A total of 32 children (8.4 to 12.1 years), 20 residents, and 14 board-certified surgeons (total n = 66) performed several VR and 2 conventional tasks (cube/spatial and pegboard/fine motor). Performance between the groups was compared (primary outcome). VR performance was correlated with conventional task performance (secondary outcome). Results: Lowest VR performance was found in children with low video game experience, followed by those with high video game experience, residents, and board-certified surgeons. VR performance correlated well with the spatial test and moderately with the fine motor test. Conclusions: The use of computer games can be considered not only as pure entertainment but may also contribute to the development of skills relevant for adequate performance in VR laparoscopic tasks. Spatial skills are relevant for VR laparoscopic task performance.},

A survey of 147 eleven-year-old computer game players attending a summer camp revealed that their main reasons for playing were for fun, for a challenge, because there was nothing else to do, and because their friends did. Males played computer games significantly more regularly than did females and were significantly more likely to play sports simulation games and violent games. Females were found to play platform games and puzzlers significantly more than did males. It is suggested that computer game playing for most children is a fairly absorbing and harmless activity but that, for a small minority of children, it may be problematic.},

Examples of this kind of media are shared whiteboard presentations and networked computer games. One key problem of this media class is that a large amount of common functionality is currently redesigned and redeveloped for each single medium. In order to solve this problem we present a media model and an application level protocol called RTP/I. Derived from the experience gained with audio and video transmission using RTP, RTP/I is defined as a new protocol framework which reuses many aspects of RTP while it is thoroughly adapted to meet the demands of distributed interactive media. By identifying and supporting the common aspects of distributed interactive media RTP/I allows the reuse of key functionality in form of generic services. Furthermore RTP/I makes it possible for applications of different vendors to interact with each other in a standardized way.},

However, I will argue, using the theory of Stuart Hall, Naomi Klein, Henry Jenkins and others, that below its progressive fa\{\c{c}\}ade The Sims amounts to an exploitation of diversity initiated by targeting untraditional markets to better tap into the consuming potential of millions of non-white, non-male, non-heterosexual people \{$\backslash$textendash\} what Hall sees as the commercial appropriation of difference. I want to suggest that the spike in social liberalism may not be the result of a socio-cultural change in ideology, but instead reflects a change in how traditionally marginalized people are marketed to in late capitalism.

abstract = {One of the major challenges of video game design is to have appropriate difficulty levels for users in order to maximize the entertainment value of the game. Game players may lose interests if a game is either too easy or too difficult. This paper presents a novel methodology to improve user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s experience in computer games by automatically adjusting the level of the game difficulty. The difficulty level is computed from measurements of the facial physiology of the players at a distance. The measurements are based on the assumption that the players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} performance during. the game-playing session alters blood flow in the supraorbital region, which is an indirect measurement of increased mental activities. This alters heat dissipation, which can be monitored in a contact-free manner through a thermal imaging-based stress monitoring and analysis system, known as StressCam.In this work, we investigated on two primary objectives: (1) the feasibility of utilizing the facial physiology in automatically adjusting the difficulty level of the game and (2) the capability of the automatic difficulty level adjustment in improving game players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} experience. We employed and extended a XNA video game for this study, and performed an in-depth, comparative usability evaluation on it. Our results show that the automatic difficulty adjustable system successfully maintains game players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} interests and substantially outperforms traditional fixed-difficulty mode games. Although a number of issues of this preliminary study remain to be investigated further, this research opens a new direction that utilizes non-contact stress measurements for monitoring and further enhancing a variety of user-centric, interactive entertainment activities.},

abstract = {In this work, we describe the evolutionary training of artificial neural network controllers for competitive team game playing behaviors by teams of real mobile robots. This research emphasized the development of methods to automate the production of behavioral robot controllers. We seek methods that do not require a human designer to define specific intermediate behaviors for a complex robot task. The work made use of a real mobile robot colony (EVolutionary roBOTs) and a closely coupled computer-based simulated training environment. The acquisition of behavior in an evolutionary robotics system was demonstrated using a robotic version of the game Capture the Flag. In this game, played by two teams of competing robots, each team tries to defend its own goal while trying to \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}attack\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} another goal defended by the other team. Robot neural controllers relied entirely on processed video data for sensing of their environment. Robot controllers were evolved in a simulated environment using evolutionary training algorithms. In the evolutionary process, each generation consisted of a competitive tournament of games played between the controllers in an evolving population. Robot controllers were selected based on whether they won or lost games in the course of a tournament. Following a tournament, the neural controllers were ranked competitively according to how many games they won and the population was propagated using a mutation and replacement strategy. After several hundred generations, the best performing controllers were transferred to teams of real mobile robots, where they exhibited behaviors similar to those seen in simulation including basic navigation, the ability to distinguish between different types of objects, and goal tending behaviors.},

abstract = {Sampling strategies have critical implications for the validity of a researcher's conclusions. Despite this, sampling is frequently ignored in research methods textbooks, during the research design process, and in the reporting of our journals. This lack of guidance often leads reviewers and journal editors to consider sampling using simple rules of thumb, which leads to the unnecessary and counterproductive characterization of sampling strategies as universally "good" or "bad." Such oversimplification slows the progress of our science by considering legitimate data sources to be categorically unacceptable. Instead, we argue that sampling is better understood in methodological terms of range restriction and omitted variables bias. This considered approach has far-reaching implications, because in I/O psychology, as in most social sciences, virtually all of our samples are convenience samples. Organizational samples are not gold standard research sources; instead, they are merely a specific type of convenience sample with their own positive and negative implications for validity. This fact does not condemn our science but instead highlights the need for more careful consideration of how and when a finding may generalize based upon the particular mix of validity-related affordances provided by each sample source that might be used to investigate a particular research question. We call for researchers to explore such considerations cautiously and explicitly in both the publication and review of research.},

abstract = {The education and training of IT in interrelation to business management at universities is seen more more critical in the last years because of often delivered \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}inactive\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} knowledge and the lack of reference to reality. By contrast surveys of companies and management executives disclose a strong need for IT managers with a wide range of knowledge and skills: Holistic competencies for analysis of business values, (strategic) decision making in strong time restrictions, thinking in processes, and in particular the ability for communication, discussion and presention.One effective way for the instruction of sustainable and future-oriented decision making is the work with computer-supported business games.Realistic web-based business games for IT and management training, however, can reach a high complexity and in most of the cases demand various elements like user administration, authorization, community tools and a dynamic business model of the simulated company. Hence, a \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}from scratch\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} development of an online platform for business games is a very laborious and time-consuming process. Existent open source portals can provide a powerful basis for the online business game development. Portals deliver a solution for the aggregation of content and individual applications and moreover offer a single point of contact, customized views and even collaboration features via an easy-to-use web interface.Because of the disclosed source code of open source portal projects, the portal features can be enhanced with the requirements of a business game like the business model or the specific views on business ratio systems or game management tools. These applications are plugged into the portal as so called portlets or portlet applications. On the basis of academic research the chair for information systems of Prof. Helmut Krcmar at the TU Munchen in cooperation with the management consultancy Accenture designed, implemented and evaluated a web-based, computer-supported business game for IT management training for students and entrants in IT management. The current online version of the business game is totally integrated into an open source portal structure."Go4C" regards a holistic approach for the strategic and operational IT- and business planning, controlling and monitoring. The fundamental training aims are derived from current studies and interviews with executives of the first and second leadership level in different industries in connection with learning theory, didactical principles and multimedia integration.In our paper we give insights into the conceptual and technical framework of the business game "Go4C" on the basis of the "Liferay" open source portal. Moreover the paper delivers an overview of the different game concepts and the didactical framework behind the business game. Finally we present first evaluation results of the practical trainings with students and executives in IT strategy.},

To test this hypothesis, 116 adolescents (14-15 years old) had to judge prospectively or retrospectively the duration of three consecutive tasks: a 8 min and a 24 min task of playing video game (Tetris) and an 8 min task of reading on a computer screen (control task). The main hypothesis received support: for a same duration, the video game task was estimated as shorter than the reading task. Moreover, participants with a game-inclined profile showed a stronger underestimation of time while playing. Finally, the short durations were overestimated and the long duration underestimated. The main findings are accounted for by an attention-based explanation.},

abstract = {On the basis of the commercially sold computer game Quake III Arena((R)) we developed a three-dimensional, interactive, virtual environment (VE) to investigate interactive behavior in romantic couples. The behavior of 64 couples was quantified using objective behavior parameters of two virtual agents in a series of diagnostically relevant situations in the VE. The mean distance between the agents, the frequency of gaze toward the partner, and the frequency of mutual gaze between partners showed substantial and theoretically meaningful relationships with the attitude toward the partner and communication patterns, but not with. relationship satisfaction and partner specific romantic attachment. The effect sizes of correlations were in line with typical correlations between questionnaire and behavior measures in the relationship literature. The results confirm the validity of the VE as an alternative method to the much more costly observation study in the laboratory. Individual differences in experience with similar computer games did not influence the results, and the occurrence of cybersickness was successfully prevented by an appropriate graphic layout.},

The main aim of the research was to test the hypothesis that participants using the game for practice would perform better in terms of the accuracy in applying the triage protocol than a group that practised triage with a table-top exercise. The method of giving in-game formative feedback to the learner was modified within the trial programme and that provided the opportunity to investigate whether changing the complexity and timing of feedback affected learning transfer through performance measured in a realistic assessment activity. The results showed that the participants who practised using the game were significantly more accurate for certain measures of performance in applying the triage protocol. The participants that received a modified in-game feedback that reduced complexity and the delay in giving feedback were also significantly more accurate for certain measures of performance in triaging the casualties. These findings will require further experimentation to determine which attributes of the in-game feedback have the greatest impact on the learning of the triage protocol for the given learner group.},

While higher resolutions generally provide more immersive game play they can yield reduced frame rates and/or increased costs, making choosing the optimal resolution important. Despite this importance, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no extensive study of the effects of resolution on users playing computer games. This paper presents results from extensive user studies measuring the impact of resolution on users playing First Person Shooter games. The studies focus on the effects of resolution in conjunction with low and high contrast virtual environments, full screen and windowed modes and identification of long-range objects. Analysis indicates resolution has little impact on performance over the range of conditions tested and only matters when the objects being identified are far away or small and are reduced to too few pixels to be distinguishable.

In addition to providing the individual with potential psychological benefits, identification with an online self or avatar can also increase individual and social understanding and tolerance of difference. The ability to create a character, or avatar, that can be identified with is the initial, and arguably the most important, step in the process of identification. However, this process has changed significantly with the advent and development of visually oriented games. Through participant-observation conducted in World of Warcraft and textual analysis of online forums associated with the game, this paper investigates the ways in which visual elements of online games affect the process of identifying with an online self. Ultimately, it argues that although interacting in a virtual environment where everything is immediately visible can ease the identification process, limits on character appearance, movement, and interaction imposed by visually rendering the game could simultaneously compromise this benefit.

It focused on sustaining and building player relationships and learning together rather than the accepted norm of obtaining magical items. Trust was forged through a desire to ‘‘hang out and have fun’’ and was evidenced by the joviality of their communication. The group’s ability to reflect and be consistent about its desires for camaraderie allowed it to recover from a poor performing night, which threatened to disband the group.

A few prominent experimental games (e.g. Kabul Kaboom, Passage) have demonstrated that when the rhetorical implications of a game's processes and its representational layer are in harmony, worthwhile and coherent messages can be communicated. This paper reports the findings of an extensive analysis of Activision's Kaboom! (1981) [1] that explores its rhetorical design space in the service of developing a general method for the interpretation of simple message-driven games. The paper then shows how the application of this method to even a simple game like Kaboom! reveals an unexpected range of coherent potential messages. The paper concludes with a description of a design process and assistant tool that enables those who are not game designers, or even procedurally literate, to create simple games that present editorial and expressive statements. We see this project as a concrete step forward, both analytically and in enabling production, in the field of procedural rhetoric},

abstract = {For all the critical attention paid to dystopian landscapes in recent literature and film, a similar dystopian turn within gamespace has been largely overlooked. The authors contend that post-apocalyptic digital games merit the same critical examination as their literary and cinematic counterparts, arguing that such games can provide a meaningful site in which questions about the future of technology play out against the dialectic of utopian and dystopian alternatives. Specifically, this article argues that the popular console game BioShock simultaneously celebrates and interrogates utopian notions of technological progress and free will embedded within prevailing industrial and academic conceptions of convergence. The authors explore the differing, yet complementary, conceptions of utopia put forth by critical theorists and the games industry in order to examine how BioShock\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s ambivalence toward technology\{$\backslash$textendash\}-and technologies and practices of media consumption in particular\{$\backslash$textendash\}-complicates more idealistic and totalizing forecasts for the future of media convergence.

By performing a close reading of the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s ideological content as well as its procedural strategies of transmediation, they link BioShock\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s ambivalence to the multifaceted, often conflicting nature of convergence discourse and practice within the digital games industry.},

Sociodemographics showed that the majority of players were male (approximately 85\%). Over 60\% of players were older than 19 years. The data provide clear evidence that the game clientele is very much an adult profile and suggest a different picture to the stereotypical image of an adolescent online gamer.

abstract = {Purpose – Though not new to online gamers, griefing – an act of play intended to cause grief to game players – is fairly understudied in LIS scholarship. The purpose of this paper is to expand the inventory of griefing varieties, consider their deceptive elements and examine attitudes towards the phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach – The authors collected and content analysed 80 (non-elicited) posts from the Something Awful forum thread and compared them to the results of ten (elicited) e-mail interviews. Findings – As a complex phenomenon, griefing has multiple interpretations and opposing attitudes. The thread results show that griefers, as perpetrators, have predominantly positive or neutral attitudes towards the act. About 15 per cent of the examined griefers reportedly resort to deceptive techniques. More extravagant griefs that require verbal interactions in player-versus-player (PvP) online games involve deception and often fall into two categories: scamming or greed play (prioritising personal benefits). The authors found self-reported instances of deception by scheming, luring, entrapment, pretence and verbal concealment in griefing acts. The interview respondents, as predominantly victims of griefs, do not think of griefing (or may not be aware of it) as an act of deception and primarily associate it with harassment (inciting emotional reactions) or power imposition (exerting superiority). Casual griefing – refusing to comply with the rules for mere entertainment – stands out as another griefing variety. Originality/value – With the growth of popularity of video gaming, libraries are largely unaware of griefing and should be prepared to address it in video game use policies for online gaming units or tournaments. Online gaming affords a unique opportunity to examine deception in computer-mediated human-to-human communication. The complexity of the phenomenon and associated opposing views are offered here to be weighted by the LIS scholars and professionals.},

abstract = {Studies on students’ perceptions of learning in business simulations often suggest that students like simulations and view them more positively than both lectures and case discussions. However, research on the actual learning outcomes deriving from participating in business simulations still needs to be pursued. Consequently, the purpose of this case-study article is to examine how a business simulation game contributes to the cognitive learning of novices in business studies. We describe the use of a clock-driven business simulation for teaching 133 novices in business studies at the University of Turku, Finland. The students’ cognitive learning was evaluated based on data generated by pre- and post-game concept map tests designed to illustrate the formation and change of mental models during the simulation course. The results of this study suggest that simulation games can provide a solid basis for novice learning. They help to increase comprehension of the complexity of business organizations and the various processes, transactions, and operations involved.},

abstract = {Recently, the demand for semiconductor devices has been greatest in the consumer market for such products as video games, cellular phones, and DVD players. In order to satisfy these demands, semiconductor manufacturers are now designing new production lines, such as mini fabs, to decrease the processing time for various types of semiconductor devices. Over the past few decades, the availability and throughput of ion implanters have improved dramatically. However, the implantation process itself has, except for a slight change, remained basically the same, A recent article (Ref. 1) describes the basic concept of an ion-implantation process that does not require use of a photoresist mask. This article reports the experimental data and the basic functions of a type of ion implanter currently being developed. This implanter implants ions in one chip at a time through a stencil mask without the use of a photoresist mask. This ion-implantation technology, called stencil mask ion implantation technology, and the ion implanter, called a stencil mask lithographic ion implanter, will be exceptionally suitable for future semiconductor manufacturing processes.},

abstract = {The use of electronic media is playing an ever greater role in adolescents\&\#39; recreational behaviour. From the point of view of the health sciences, one question which arises is the extent to which intensive media use is detrimental to physical activity and adolescents\&\#39; health development. The data from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), which were evaluated with a focus on 11-17-year-olds, confirm this heavy use of electronic media. However, there are distinct group-specific differences. For example, boys spend more time than girls on computers, the internet and games consoles, whereas girls more often listen to music and use their mobile phones. Watching television and videos is equally popular among girls and boys. Adolescents of low social status or a low level of school education use electronic media far more frequently and for longer times, especially television and video, games consoles and mobile phones. The same is true of boys and girls from the former states of the GDR and for boys (but not girls) with a background of migration. A connection to physical activity has been established for adolescents who spend more than five hours a day using electronic media. Moreover, this group of heavy users is more often affected by adiposity. The results of the KiGGS study, which are in line with earlier research findings, thus demonstrate that the use of electronic media is also of relevance from the point of view of public health and should be included in investigations into the health of children and adolescents.

They use many differ- ent types of media to deliver an interactive narrative to the players and include puzzles that are part of a bigger quest that the players are trying to solve. They are not widely used in education and there is limited amount of research done considering their benefits to learning. However, espe- cially some commercial entertainment ARGs have managed to engage people in collaborative problem solving very well. Therefore, benefits and issues of using ARGs in education, and especially in computer science education (CSE), are dis- cussed in this paper. Alternate reality games could poten- tially be used to teach various computer science concepts, to enable student networking, and to promote computer science programs. A case study was conducted in order to research the potential of using alternate reality games in computer science education. The research of the case study is still in progress, but the preliminary results are promising.

Commercial data mining software and sales data from a market research firm are used to create a predictive model of market success in the video game industry. A procedure is then described for transforming the classification trees into a decision-analytic model that can be solved to produce a value-maximizing game development policy. The video game example shows how the compact predictive models created by data mining algorithms can help to make decision-analytic feedforward control feasible, even for large, complex problems. However, the example also highlights the bounds placed on the practicality of the approach due to combinatorial explosions in the number of contingencies that have to be modeled. We show, for example, how the "option value" of sequels creates complexity that is effectively impossible to address using conventional decision analysis tools. $\backslash$copyright2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The specific aim of this paper is to evaluate the utility of building virtual environments in influencing girls\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} interest in computer-related educational paths and careers. This is evaluated through an intervention, or action-research, in the form of a class named \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}Gaming for Girls.\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} This class was offered to middle and high school girls three times over the years 2005-2006. We assert playing and developing computer games can lead to the acquisition of tangible IT skills and a higher sense of self-efficacy in terms of computer use. In particular, we discuss intervention methods that aim at changing socialization patterns by bringing girls into an all-girl classroom, reducing game violence by altering the forms of game action, and removing potentially negative character designs by allowing girls to design characters and game interaction themselves. We assert that within the information economy, playing video games is an advantage.

As children of the Baby Boomers, the Internet is the medium of choice for the Net-geners. Based on the assumption that Net-generation has unique characteristics, this study examined (1) how Net-geners addicted to the Internet differ from the non-addicted and (2) how these attributes, together with the seductive properties of the Internet, are related to Internet addiction. Data were gathered from a probability sample of 699 Net-geners between the ages of 16 and 24. Results show that Net-geners addicted to the Internet tend to be young female students. Being emotionally open on the Net and a heavy user of ICQ were most influential in predicting Net-geners\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} problematic use of the Internet. Addicted Net-geners are also strongly linked to the pleasure of being able to control the simulated world in online games. The finding reinforces previous research that "dependents" of the Internet spend most of their time in the synchronous communication environment engaging in interactive online games, chat rooms, and ICQ for pleasure-seeking or escape, while "non-dependents" use information-gathering functions available on the Internet. Furthermore, Internet addicts tend to watch television significantly less, indicating a displacement effect on traditional media use for the Net-generation.},

This paper especially focuses on the robust and real-time Bayesian network (BN) based multi-cue fusion fist tracking method. Firstly, a new strategy, which employs the latest work in face recognition, is used to create accurate color model of the fist automatically. Secondly, color cue and motion cue are used to generate the possible position of the fist. Then, the posterior probability of each possible position is evaluated by BN, which fuses color cue and appearance cue. Finally, the fist position is approximated by the hypothesis that maximizes a posterior. Based on the proposed control system, a racing car game, "Simulation Drive", has been developed by our group. Through the game an entirely new experience can be obtained by the player.},

All 16 schools of the same school district were randomized into two groups: games group and control group, both receiving conventional nutritional teaching by their teachers. The children in the games group played computer games during the conventional nutritional teaching period (2 hours a week for 5 weeks). At completion of the study, dietetic knowledge and dietary records were evaluated in both groups. Results: Dietary knowledge tests results were better in the games group (p < 0.001). The children in the games group had a significantly better balanced diet for an energy intake of about 1900 kilocalories: more carbohydrate (46.4 +/- 0.2\% vs 45.7 +/- 0.2\%, p < 0.05), less fat(37.1 +/- 0.1\% vs 37.6 +/- 0.2\%, p < 0.05), less protein (16.5 +/- 0.1\% vs 16.7 +/- 0.1\%, p < 0.05), less saccharose (11.5 +/- 0.1\% vs 12.2 +/- 0.2\%, p < 0.001), more calcium (p < 0.001) and more fiber (p < 0.05). The games group had a better snack at 10 a.m., a less copious lunch and less nibbling (p < 0.001), Conclusion: The children in the games group had slightly but significantly better nutritional knowledge and dietary intake compared to children in the control group. Using our micro computer nutritional teaching games at school provides an additional and modern support to conventional teaching.},

This article proposes studying the social discourse of video games by analyzing the relationships between game design, the transmission of ideological values, and the construction of social reality. With this aim, an analysis model is constructed based on game design theory and studies of the expressive potential of video games. This model is based on the following three facets of the video game discourse: (1) the rep- resentation of the character/player, (2) the game world, and (3) the main actions carried out in it. The fundamental resources of the ludic design and their expressive value are discussed in depth for each aspect. The model is applied to acasestudy of Grand Theft Auto IV.},

In this paper we explore the model of improvisation as a means of understanding the relationship between the author/designer and the reader/player of such narratives. This model allows for a new formulation of the notion of agency, by shifting the concept of the reader from a player-centric model to a performer-centric model. We also show how we can conceive of interactions between performers and authors as being governed by the same rules that are in play between multiple performers in a piece of improvisational theatre. We connect this idea to a phenomenological theory of human computer interaction and cognition which foregrounds the role of communication and commitment between interactors.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of time children are spending on computers at home and school has raised questions about how the use of computer technology may make a difference in their lives-from helping with homework to causing depression to encouraging violent behavior. This article provides an overview of the limited research on the effects of home computer use on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physical, cognitive, and social development. Initial research suggests, for example, that access to computers increases the total amount of time children spend in front of a television or computer screen at the expense of other activities, thereby putting them at risk for obesity. At the same time, cognitive research suggests that playing computer games can be an important building block to computer literacy because it enhances children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s ability to read and visualize images in three-dimensional space and track multiple images simultaneously. The limited evidence available also indicates that home computer use is linked to slightly better academic performance. The research findings are more mixed, however regarding the effects on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s social development. Although little evidence indicates that the moderate use of computers to play games has a negative impact on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s friendships and family relationships, recent survey data show that increased use of the Internet may be linked to increases in loneliness and depression. Of most concern are the findings that playing violent computer games may increase aggressiveness and desensitize a child to suffering, and that the use of computers may blur a child\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s ability to distinguish real life from simulation. The authors conclude that more systematic research is needed in these areas to help parents and policymakers maximize the positive effects and to minimize thr negative effects of home computers in children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s lives.},

Questionnaire items were administered over the Internet to 442 game players. Factor-analysis of the data supported the previous findings for computing in general. An addiction factor loaded on items tapping previously identified core criteria (conflict, withdrawal symptoms, relapse and reinstatement and behavioral salience) and a (non-pathological) engagement factor loaded on items tapping previously identified peripheral criteria (cognitive salience, tolerance and euphoria). Analysis of response frequencies supported the existence of a developmental process whereby peripheral criteria are met before core criteria. Players who might be considered addicted using a monothetic classification system involving only the core criteria were shown to spend a significantly greater amount of time playing per week than those endorsing only the peripheral criteria. It is concluded that the study supports the idea that it is inappropriate to use some of the previously used criteria for addiction when researching or diagnosing computer-related addictions.

We examined the effect of activity-enhancing screen devices on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s energy expenditure compared with performing the same activities while seated. Our hypothesis was that energy expenditure would be significantly greater when children played activity-promoting video games, compared with sedentary video games.METHODS. Energy expenditure was measured for 25 children aged 8 to 12 years, 15 of whom were lean, while they were watching television seated, playing a traditional video game seated, watching television while walking on a treadmill at 1.5 miles per hour, and playing activity-promoting video games.RESULTS. Watching television and playing video games while seated increased energy expenditure by 20 +/- 13\% and 22 +/- 12\% above resting values, respectively. When subjects were walking on the treadmill and watching television, energy expenditure increased by 138 +/- 40\% over resting values. For the activity-promoting video games, energy expenditure increased by 108 +/- 40\% with the EyeToy (Sony Computer Entertainment) and by 172 +/- 68\% with Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2 (Konami Digital Entertainment).CONCLUSIONS. Energy expenditure more than doubles when sedentary screen time is converted to active screen time. Such interventions might be considered for obesity prevention and treatment.},

Careful examination of learning opportunities present in gaming requires us to direct our attention to the characteristics of MMORPGs and how these characteristics support learning. MMORPGs accommodate active learners who assume the role of characters they have selected, create immersive environments that promote the development of conceptual knowledge and engage players in social interaction among a community of players. Since MMORPGs support social interaction between players, MMORPGs serve as the catalyst for fostering students language proficiency as students interact in a foreign language while playing the game. For these reasons, we believe that MMORPGs embody an interesting and underutilized learning environment for second language acquisition. Based upon this premise, we introduce a game-language learning model and explore Sony Online Entertainments 3D game Ever Quest II as a pedagogical tool for students learning English as a second language.},

abstract = {Virtual worlds for children are becoming increasingly popular, and yet there are few accounts of children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s use of these worlds. Young children are spending increasing amounts of time online as technology continues to create significant changes in social and cultural practices in the 21st century. Some of children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s online interactions can be categorized as playful in nature; however, play and technology are frequently positioned as oppositional. In this article, I explore the tensions surrounding the relationship between play and technology and relate it to similar discourses concerning the concepts of \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}real\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}virtual\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}. I then move on to consider the growing popularity of virtual worlds with young children and examine the way in which the worlds have been marketed to children and parents/carers on the basis of their propensity to offer online play in a safe environment. The article provides an overview of two virtual worlds currently targeted at young children and draws on a survey of primary children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s use of virtual worlds in order to identify the nature of play in these environments. One hundred and seventy-five children aged 5\{$\backslash$textemdash\}11 completed an online survey and 15 took part in group interviews in which their use of virtual worlds was explored. This article focuses on the data relating to 17 children aged from five to seven years who used virtual worlds. Findings indicate that virtual worlds offered these young children a wide range of opportunities for play and that the types of play in which they engaged relate closely to \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}offline\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} play. The implications for early years educators are considered. },

abstract = {This paper offers a preliminary analysis of a web-based questionnaire on mobile culture and entertainment. Respondents were found to value the advice of those in their informal social and knowledge networks when choosing mobile operators and ME products and services. Respondents demonstrated their reluctance to switch operators, in spite of indications of dissatisfaction with their current providers. Despite high usage levels of fixed-line Internet for entertainment purposes respondents were less than enthusiastic about mobile entertainment. Gaming, taking and sending pictures, watching video clips and listening to music on mobiles were all met with a lack of enthusiasm, with the majority of our sample emphasising the importance of the more \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}traditional\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} communicative functions of mobiles. Evidence of conflicting views on content pricing and handset usability demonstrates the embryonic nature of the ME market. Consumer expectations are still in the process of being formed. In terms of consumer concerns, our results suggest that health worries and the protection of minors from \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}inappropriate material\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} were minimal amongst this particular set of respondents. \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}Junk text\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} was highlighted as the major source of concern. Respondents appeared reluctant to buy into the convergence trope of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}one device for all\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} although modernist notions of continuous technological progress were evident in user expectations. Given the \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}early adopter\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}highlevel user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} status of the majority of our respondents, their views on the future direction of mobile entertainment services are highly relevant here. Further work is needed to reach a greater understanding of the relationship between user and technology, between consumer and mobile entertainment product, as this embryonic market gradually matures.},

abstract = {Understanding players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} visual attention patterns within an
interactive 3D game environment is an important research area
that can improve game level design and graphics. Several
graphics techniques use a perception based rendering method to
enhance graphics quality while achieving the fast rendering speed
required for fast-paced 3D video games. Game designers can also
enhance game play by adjusting the level design, texture and
color choices, and objects\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} locations, if such decisions are
informed by a study of players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} visual attention patterns in 3D
game environments. This paper seeks to address this issue. We
present results showing different visual attention patterns that
players exhibit in two different game types: action-adventure
games and first person shooter games. In addition, analyzing
visual attention patterns within a complex 3D game environment
presents a new challenge because the environment is very
complex with many rapidly changing conditions; the methods
used in previous research cannot be used in such environments. In
this paper, we will discuss our exploration seeking a new
approach to analyze visual attention patterns within interactive 3D
environments.

abstract = {Storytelling can play a critical role in the success of modern video games. Unfortunately, it can often be quite difficult for storytellers to directly craft content for games, typically
requiring them to work with programmers to implement story elements. This needlessly complicates the development process, straining scarce resources while potentially hampering
creativity and story quality at the same time. As a result, supports and tools are necessary to enable storytellers to generate story content for games directly, with minimal programming or programmer assistance required, if any.

This paper introduces a Reusable Scripting Engine to automate the generation of cinematics and cut-scenes in video games. This approach allows storytellers to provide their
stories in a well-defined, structured format, which is then interpreted by our engine, along with supplemental graphic and audio content, to produce an animated presentation of the story in an automated fashion. This paper presents the design of our Reusable Scripting Engine, and discusses a prototype implementation of this design, as well as initial experiences with using this prototype system to date.},

In order to investigate the future of pervasive game playing on mobile devices the University of Tampere Hypermedia Laboratory\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s research project Wireless Gaming Solutions for the Future (MOGAME) has developed a prototype of a persistent multiplayer game. Rather than starting from the research team\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s own game preferences or by analyzing or imitating existing games, the team decided to commence the game design process by researching different "real players" and their preferences. The player study used gameplay scenarios that were presented to the informants in a comic strip format. After analysis, the key findings were summarized into design requirements that were then adopted as goals for the game design. A player-centred game design approach like this can be laborious and has its challenges, but it also provided useful information and inspiration for design. Thus, we argue that players should be more involved in game design and development than is currently typical. This paper describes and evaluates the experiences gathered while using a scenario-based player study to inform pervasive mobile game design.},

The program provides a comprehensive authoring shell using which non technical staff can produce complete adventures tailored to their clients\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} needs. Each stage of an adventure provides a short introduction explaining either the starting problem or the results of the last choice made and offering up to three choices of action. Once an option is selected OPTEXI will move on to show the results of that choice and offer a new set of options appropriate to the situation. In a therapeutic context the worker and client together can explore the likely consequences of different solutions to a problem and work through to the best solution. Practical use of the program has suggested that this approach is less threatening. An IBM compatible version of OPTECI is currently in progress.},

Essentially gender-specific games comparable to the "games for girls" proposed by the girls' game movement in the USA, Japanese women's games are significant for their history, influence and function as a site for female gamers to play out various female identities and romantic fantasies within diverse generic structures. This article will first review previous research and literature on women and gaming, analyze the key issues raised in the discourse concerning femininity and electronic games, outline the history and development of women's games, explain how multiple factors contributed to the appeal of women's games by analyzing the games Angelique and Harukanaru Tokino Nakade3 and, lastly, discuss the meaning and significance of women's games in the larger context of women and gaming. The 1994 game Angelique succeeded in establishing a loyal and close-knit fan base by actively utilizing popular female culture such as shoujo manga (girls\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} comics) and the fan base for voice actors. Angelique also set up the specifics and conventions of women\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s games: a focus on romance, easy controls and utilizing other multimedia. In 2004, Harukanaru Tokino Nakade3 deconstructed the genre and gender conventions of women\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s games and shoujo manga, while developing a new type of feminine identity and narrative. Women\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s games indicate that gender-specific games can be more than educational tools to familiarize girls with technology or perpetuate stereotypes; they can be a significant extension of female culture into the realm of gaming, and contribute to the development of women\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s culture and the diversification of the gaming industry.},

abstract = {As pervasive gaming becomes more common, the question of what boundaries and rituals make up play attains greater importance. While commonly-held conceptions of play formulate it as delineated, rigid, structured, and characterized by a stringent set of symbolic boundaries, pervasive mobile games push at the walls of the demarcated magic circle and, in the process of seeking multiple theoretical transgressions, pose questions about the implication of players and non-players in games that can mask their status as such. This paper prods the ethics of transgressing the player/non-player divide through the analysis of several pervasive games and the design frameworks of their creators.},

abstract = {As players craft and enact embodiment in digital games, the relationship between social interaction and gender (male/female) versus gender-role identity (masculinity/femininity) remains unclear. This paper examines differences in chat, avatar movement, and avatar appearance among male players who played male and female avatars. Initial analysis reveals that gender-based playstyles are distinct from gender role-based playstyles. Most importantly, men playing female avatars retain patterns typical of male players; however they depart from patterns typical of high-masculinity players. Specifically, gender-switching males tended to reject masculine behaviors in favor of flirting, using more punctuation, and deferring physical leadership. We interpret this to mean that male gender-switchers do not shed male behaviors and, instead of performing normatively feminine behaviors, work to counteract masculine behaviors – they try to act “not-masculine.” These findings have implications for gameplay scholarship where offline gender is unknown and for integrating gender roles as key to studying gender in games.},

abstract = {Lighting design is an important element of scene composition. Designers use lighting to influence viewers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} perception by evoking moods, directing their gaze to important areas, and conveying dramatic tension. Lighting is a very time consuming task; designers typically spend hours manipulating lights\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} colors, positions, and angles to create a lighting design that accommodates dramatic action and tension. Such manual design is inappropriate for interactive narrative, because the spatial and dramatic characteristics of an interactive scene, including dramatic tension, camera location, and character actions, change unpredictably, necessitating continual redesign as the scene progresses. In this paper, we present a lighting design system, called ELE (Expressive Lighting Engine), that automatically, in real-time, adjusts angles, positions, and colors of lights to accommodate the dramatic and spatial characteristics of a scene, while conforming to the established style and ensuring visual continuity. ELE uses constraint-based non-linear optimization algorithms to configure lights using cost functions formulated based on traditional film and theatrical lighting design theory.},

FARMTASIA is the first online game designed using the VISOLE philosophy, encompassing the subject areas of biology, government, economics, technology, production system and natural environment. The "virtual world" deployed is a farming system covering the domains of cultivation, horticulture and pasturage, situated in a competitive economy governed by good public policies. The design and implementation of FARMTASIA pursue three vital principles. The first one is to make the game as realistic as possible so that students can learn in a near-real life environment; the second one is to inject motivational elements so that students can sustain to learn and acquire various knowledge and skills with the game; and the third one is to make easy for teachers to conduct various VISOLE facilitation tasks. According to our exploratory educational study, we show evidentially that positive perceptions and an advancement of subject-specific and interdisciplinary knowledge appeared among the students who participated in VISOLE learning with FARMTASIA. $\backslash$copyright2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

Traditional visual games are already used widely in cellular phones and similar devices. A significant limitation is the small display size. In contrast, audio only games on suitable mobile hardware need not degrade due to the smaller form factor. This makes audio only games an attractive alternative to visual games. We describe a framework for authoring interactive narrative-based audio only games set in 3D virtual environments. Despite the novelty in audio only gaming, our approach builds on a foundation of several years of research into audio only applications for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and human-computer interaction studies. In comparison to attempts to provide a realistic user interface, we argue a simple interface enhances both immersion and entertainment value, serendipitously making audio only games practical for mobile computing. Novel features of our system include real-time gameplay and multi-player support. We also describe our software architecture, the current implementation of which uses low-cost existing PC-based hardware and software. In addition, we describe our first game, Dragon\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Roar.},

Cross-sectional studies have suggested that children who were less physically active and children who watched more television (TV) had more excess body weight, but no large nationwide longitudinal studies have addressed whether children who change their personal levels of activity or inactivity, from one year to the next, experience changes in adiposity. Our objective is to study the association between change in body mass index (BMI) over 1 year and same year change in recreational physical activity and change in recreational inactivity (TV/videos/video games). Design. Cohort study using data from 2 mailed questionnaires, 1 year apart. Participants. A total of 11 887 boys and girls, aged 10 to 15, who returned questionnaires in both 1997 and 1998 as part of the Growing Up Today Study. Outcome Measure. Change in BMI from 1997-1998, accounting for increases in BMI associated with growth and development. Results. An increase in physical activity from 1997 1998 was associated with decreasing relative BMI in girls (-0.06 kg/m(2) per hour increase in daily activity; 95\% confidence interval : -0.11, -0.01) and in overweight boys (-0.22 kg/m(2); CI: -0.33, -0.10). An increase in inactivity was associated with increasing BMI in girls (-0.05 kg/m(2) per hour increase in daily TV/videos/video games; CI: +0.02, +0.08). Effects were generally stronger among overweight children. Increasing time doing aerobics/dancing and walking were associated with BMI declines for some groups of children. Conclusions. Many children may benefit by increasing their physical activity and by reducing time watching TV or videos and playing video games. In particular, 2 activities accessible to most children, aerobics/dancing and walking, also appeared beneficial.},

abstract = {Despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. This report addresses the problem of how to apply the concept of gender-inclusivity into game design. A central contribution of the research is the development of a gender-inclusivity framework. The conceptual framework is founded on the analysis and synthesized information from related theories and research. It demonstrates how the concept of gender-inclusivity can be defined and expressed in three key components: 1) genre, which indicate the type of game, (2) gameplay, which describes the game behaviour e.g. conflict resolution, feedback, challenge and flexibility, (3) aesthetics content, which describes the game content including character/avatar, music, storyline and game world graphics. This framework can be use as a reference point by providing a common vocabulary for discussing issues of gender-inclusivity i.e. literature, methods and results. In addition to that, it serves as a boundary of what constitutes gender-inclusivity in games. Subsequently, it acts as a filtering tool for what is relevant and not relevant to gender-inclusivity in games. Two novel applications of the gender-inclusivity framework are presented.

The first is a measuring instrument called the Gender-Inclusivity Rating Scale (GIRS). The GIRS instrument was designed to assess the degree of gender-inclusiveness in a game. The second application extends the notion of gender-inclusivity to design practice. The Gender-Inclusive Game Design Model (GIGaDM) guides designers in the design process. It helps to deconstruct the overall gender-inclusivity design tasks into smaller, conceptually distinct and manageable tasks. Finally, the direction of future work is outlined.},

A range of traditional and emerging narrative techniques are considered, including The Hero\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Journey, three-act structure, the portrayal of human emotions, and character archetypes, from where an in-depth examination of interactive narrative is performed on a range of old and modern games. Initial results pertaining to the time allocated to narrative, the use of back stories, cut scenes, on-screen text, prompts, and game structure are also presented, which reveal a distinct level of uniformity of how interactive narrative is depicted in games spanning over two decades of industry development. The analysis is concluded in the second article, where further results are revealed to help uncover the precise nature of game narratives.},

We propose to view aspects of gameplay as speech acts, as defined by Austin and Searle, and we present several examples that illustrate the diverse locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts present in the design of digital games. Through our perspective, we are able to cast problems relevant to the interactive entertainment community as discourse problems, where an interactive system must determine what to “say,” in order to elicit in the minds of players a specific mental model that will allow them to perform successfully in the game. We conclude with a research agenda that proposes to leverage the artificial intelligence paradigm of discourse planning to tackle the discourse problems of interactive entertainment.},

abstract = {Since the advent of the study of games, scholars have emphasised the idea of games as subsets of the real world, as make-believe and as representational systems. Games have been understood as delimited from the real world by a physical and conceptual boundary that clearly defines what should be understood as part of the game. Players enter and leave the game at will, voluntarily accepting the rules of the game when entering the game subspace, and there is no doubt that players are fully capable of knowing when they cross this boundary, and when they should interpret a specific action as part of the game or not. This paper asks how researchers can investigate the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s comprehension of the relationship between a game and the world methodologically by the use of qualitative approaches. The motivation for the paper is a postdoctoral research project facing precisely these issues, and the paper serves as a work in progress for developing a qualitative research method for investigating player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s understanding of system features, interface elements and what constitutes the game border in computer games. The paper will present the aims of the postdoctoral research project and shortly describe its hypotheses and theoretical points of departure before going on to discuss and suggest methods for investigating these hypotheses.},

It is also assumed that entropy may be evaluated from the correlation coefficients obtained for the game event-related activity calculated for the different electroencephalogram derivations in the 10/20 system. The brain mapping derived from these entropy measurements clearly demonstrates the reallocation of speech functions to right brain areas when the classic left language circuits are damaged during prenatal life.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the relationship between the presence of a television set, a gaming computer, and/or an Internet connection in the room of adolescents and television viewing, computer game playing, and Internet use on the one hand, and time to bed, time up, time spent in bed, and overall tiredness in first- and fourth-year secondary-school children on the other hand. Methods: A random sample of students from 15 schools in Flanders, Belgium, yielded 2546 children who completed a questionnaire with questions about media presence in bedrooms; volume of television viewing, computer game playing, and Internet use; time to bed and time up on average weekdays and average weekend days; and questions regarding the level of tiredness in the morning, at school, after a day at school, and after the weekend. Results: Children with a television set in their rooms went to bed significantly later on weekdays and weekend days and got up significantly later on weekend days. Overall, they spent less time in bed on weekdays. Children with a gaming computer in their rooms went to bed significantly later on weekdays. On weekdays, they spent significantly less time in bed. Children who watched more television went to bed later on weekdays and weekend days and got up later on weekend days. They spent less time in bed on weekdays. They reported higher overall levels of being tired. Children who spent more time playing computer games went to bed later on weekdays and weekend days and got up later on weekend days. On weekdays, they actually got up significantly earlier. They spent less time in bed on weekdays and reported higher levels of tiredness. Children who spent more time using the Internet went to bed significantly later during the week and during the weekend. They got up later on weekend days. They spent less time in bed during the week and reported higher levels of tiredness. Going out was also significantly related to sleeping later and less. Conclusion: Concerns about media use should not be limited to television. Computer game playing and Internet use are related to sleep behavior as well. Leisure activities that are unstructured seem to be negatively related to good sleep patterns. Imposing more structure (eg, end times) might reduce impact.},

The ETO environment that serves as the Working case allows the eliciting of important PLM concepts: unified product development multiproject planning and manufacturing planning, links between PLM software and ERP systems, and emphasis on the PLM holistic approach. The game is designed as a series of group sessions in which the different planning decisions appear progressively so that in the last session a complete lifecycle planning problem is completed The sessions act as a series of practical cases encouraging group discussions. The computer system consists of two main components: a discrete event simulator and a planning decision supper system. The simulator guides the game and stochastically generates the different events that cause the need for planning decisions in the working case. The planning decision support system makes it possible to emulate the resolution of the day-to-day tasks.},

These include acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR), language and dialog modeling, and multimodal-multimedia user interface design. First, issues in ASR of children speech are introduced by an analysis of developmental changes in the spectral and temporal characteristics of the speech signal using data obtained from 456 children, ages five to 18 years. Acoustic modeling adaptation and vocal tract normalization algorithms that yielded state-of-the-art ASR performance on children speech are described. Second, an experiment designed to better understand how children interact with machines using spoken language is described. Realistic conversational multimedia interaction data were obtained from 160 children who played a voice-activated computer game in a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) scenario. Results of using these data in developing novel language and dialog models as well as in a unified maximum likelihood framework for acoustic decoding in ASR and semantic classification for spoken language understanding are described. Leveraging the lessons learned from the WoZ study and a concurrent user experience evaluation, a multimedia personal agent prototype for children was designed. Details of the architecture and application details are described. Informal evaluation by children was found positive especially for the animated agent and the speech interface.},

The presented theoretical framework is based on a critical analysis of crucial issues, which seem to determine the success or failure of development and implementation of an educational game in the formal school environment. It demonstrates key approaches the authors of Europe 2045 have adopted in order to overcome already known problems related to game-based learning. On a general level this paper discusses issues related to formal fact learning in educational systems and the possible role of educational games in enhancing these systems.},

abstract = {While video games have been analyzed in comparison to other new media forms by scholars like Lev Manovich, and to older media like novels and plays by scholars like Janet Murray and Brenda Laurel, few studies have examined the influence of older toys on video games. Despite this neglect, however, the connections between older toys and video games point to several important issues in hurnanities-based game studies, including those that investigate the place of game studies in academia and the archiving and preservation of games. By connecting video games to a variety of nonelectronic predecessors, this article raises several questions linked to video game classification, the hybridity of video games, and the problems that hybrid forms must negotiate. Toward this end, we specifically address movable books and toy theaters in relation to video games like Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door (2004) to show how video games both draw on and change earlier interactive entertainment formats. Overall, this article explicates the relationship between games and older forms like movable books to show how comparative studies of older forms can elucidate and inform current scholarship.

Therefore a science of fun is needed to engineer games that are engaging for players, including the design of software agents that play against and along with human beings in computer games. EVE? is a computational theory, based on a psychological progression of Expectations (E), Violations (V) and Explanations (E?) that in turn evoke emotional responses known as fun or flow. Here EVE? is developed for the case of gambling games, specifically slot machines, deriving a Bayesian-information measure of aesthetic utility that is not modeled by the economic utility of previous proposals like Prospect Theory. The derivation shows how aesthetic utility can be measured by entropy and how fun can be seen as a form of learning. EVE\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s contribution lies in going beyond classical economics and computational intelligence to analyze the aesthetics of enjoyment and engagement - towards a science of fun.},

abstract = {Using a video game format, this study examined the effects of time pressure (TP) on behavioral and electrocortical indices. The behavioral results were consistent with previous time pressure research in that TP reduced time to perform a task and increases behavioral errors. In addition, electroencephalogram (EEG) measures showed distinctive patterns associated with TP in the theta, mu, and gamma bands along the midline, Site specific changes in the success vs. failure trials were also seen in midline theta at Fz, gamma at Fz, and mu at Cz. Right parietal alpha also differentiated TP and success vs. failure trials. In specific TP (1) increased frontal midline theta activity and (2) increased gamma at. midline (frontal, central, and partietal) and in right frontal areas. The results of these findings are discussed in terms of the formation of specific neurocognitive strategies as evidenced by the topographic distribution of task-related modulation of the EEG within certain frequency bands. It is suggested that the effect of TP on visuomotor performance is mediated by adopting either task- relevant or task-irrelevant neurocognitive strategies as evidenced by successful or failed trials, respectively. Whether these strategies are formulated prior to performance or appear spontaneously during task performance remains unclear and is awaiting further experimentation.},

Findings - This paper identifies five important shifts in the conceptualization of value creation by highlighting a growing prevalence in the literature of several ecological metaphors used to explain business processes, namely: the shift from thinking about consumers to co-creators of value; the shift from thinking about value chains to value networks; the shift from thinking about product value to network value; the shift from thinking about simple co-operation or competition to complex co-opetition; and the shift from thinking about individual firm strategy to strategy in relation to value ecologies. Originality/value - This paper synthesizes emerging trends in the literature in relation to value creation and defines the concept of a value-creating ecology. In the process it sheds light on the structure of next generation business systems.},

The new field of games studies has generated three somewhat competing models of videogaming that characterize games as new forms of gaming, narratives, and interactive fictions. When treated as necessary and sufficient condition definitions, however, each of the three approaches fails to pick out all and only videogames. In this paper I argue that looking more closely at the formal qualities of definition helps to set out the range of definitional options open to the games theorist. A disjunctive definition of videogaming seems the most appropriate of these definitional options. The disjunctive definition I offer here is motivated by the observation that there is more than one characteristic way of being a videogame.},

These complex entanglements of the proprietary and the non-proprietary, the commercial and the non-commercial, are not necessarily an appropriation of fandom by corporate bottom-line agendas. However, Auran\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s effort to integrate fan content creation into the commercial game development process struggles with the problem of fundamentally reorganising the project to support this kind of collaborative work.},

Based on the historical background and unique characteristics of games, this study investigates the cultural effect of Japanese video games on players in Taiwan. This study also presents an analysis of the differences between TV and the video game as cultural vehicles. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results indi- cate a relationship between game-playing behavior and the identification of Japanese culture. However, the relationship between video game playing and consumption was nonsignificant. This shows the power of video games in nation-building but not in nation-branding, in contrast with TV. This study presents a discussion of the findings to shed light on the cultural effects of video games.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how consistency can be established for replicated applications changing their state in reaction to user-initiated operations as well as the passing of time. Typical examples of these applications are networked computer games and distributed virtual environments. We give a formal definition of the terms consistency and correctness for this application class. Based on these definitions, it is shown that an important tradeoff relationship exists between the responsiveness of the application and the appearance of short-term inconsistencies. We propose to exploit the knowledge of this tradeoff by voluntarily decreasing the responsiveness of the application in order to eliminate short-term inconsistencies. This concept is called local-lag. Furthermore, a timewarp scheme is presented that complements local-lag by guaranteeing consistency and correctness for replicated continuous applications. The computational complexity of the timewarp algorithm is determined in theory and practice by examining a simple networked computer game. The timewarp scheme is then compared to the well-known dead-reckoning approach. It is shown that the choice between both schemes is application-dependent.},

abstract = {Being one of the most commercially successful entertainment software applications, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) continue to expand in term of the revenue they generate as well as the involvement of users who congregate in their virtual space and form communities around them to support each other. Unlike conventional offline computer games, or networked games with limited numbers of players, MMORPGs are not merely software applications as they are usually seen as a space with complicated dynamics of social interactions. Hence, it is believed that playing these games might cause cognitive overload problems among the players as they have to constantly interact with the game world as well as with other users. We conducted an exploratory study using qualitative methods to explore cognitive overloads in Maple Story, a typical MMORPG. Our results reveal that several types of cognitive overloads emerge during the game playing. While some of these overloads pose serious problems even to expert players, players seem to develop strategies to overcome them. It is found that some forms of cognitive load are actually desirable in order to make the game challenging. We have also created a set of recommendations that can help game developers handle cognitive load problems in MMORPGs.},

Infants use this mechanism to redescribe perceptual information into image-schematic format. Image-schemas create conceptual structure from the spatial structure of objects and their movements, resulting in notions such as animacy, inanimacy, agency, and containment. These earliest meanings are nonpropositional, analogical representations grounded in the perceptual world of the infant. In contrast with most perceptual processing, which is not analyzed in this fashion, redescription into image-schematic format simplifies perceptual information and makes it potentially accessible for purposes of concept formation and thought. In addition to enabling preverbal thought, image-schemas provide a foundation for language acquisition by creating an interface between the continuous processes of perception and the discrete nature of language.},

abstract = {The current buzz-word in the e-Learning community is game-based learning or serious games\{$\backslash$textendash\}games whose primary focus is education not entertainment. Until recently, much e-Learning consisted of page-turner lessons created in an attempt to fill the growing demand for online courses. However, e-Learning is moving beyond merely digitizing traditional classroom course content for online accessibility. These serious games are becoming the new
model for e-Learning. A good game, including a serious game, consists of a story, a clear goal, a significant yet not impossible challenge,
meaningful actions, and appropriate feedback all rolled up in an attention-getting package. A challenge for
instructional designers in creating these serious games is changing our mindset from the traditional presentation of the lesson followed by testing to assess student comprehension. These lessons are typically in text format followed by a multiple choice test. Even when we try to jazz it up with graphics and interactivity, it is still the same old thing. In creating games, we need to move away from putting text on a screen to creating engaging learning experiences. So, how do we make the transition from instructional designers to serious game designers? What do instructional
designers need to do differently? This paper describes the challenges and lessons learned in designing two game-based courses for the U.S. Army.
We\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}ve had to adapt everything from storyboarding to the changing roles of the development team members. instructional designers need to know how games work and how to keep the educational objective from being obscured by the entertainment and glitz of the game.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the learning effectiveness and motivational appeal of a computer game for learning computer memory concepts, which was designed according to the curricular objectives and the subject matter of the Greek high school Computer Science (CS) curriculum, as compared to a similar application, encompassing identical learning objectives and content but lacking the gaming aspect. The study also investigated potential gender differences in the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s learning effectiveness and motivational appeal. The sample was 88 students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which used the gaming application (Group A, N = 47) and the other one the non-gaming one (Group B, N = 41). A Computer Memory Knowledge Test (CMKT) was used as the pretest and posttest. Students were also observed during the interventions. Furthermore, after the interventions. students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} views on the application they had used were elicited through a feedback questionnaire. Data analyses showed that the gaming approach was both more effective in promoting students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} knowledge of computer memory concepts and more motivational than the non-gaming approach. Despite boys\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} greater involvement with, liking of and experience in computer gaming, and their greater initial computer memory knowledge, the learning gains that boys and girls achieved through the use of the game did not differ significantly, and the game was found to be equally motivational for boys and girls. The results suggest that within high school CS, educational computer games can be exploited as effective and motivational learning environments, regardless of students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} gender.},

Several robotic billiards players have recently been developed. These systems address the task of executing shots on a physical table, but so far have incorporated little strategic reasoning. They require artificial intelligence to select the \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}best\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} shot taking into account the accuracy of the robot, the noise inherent in the domain, the continuous nature of the search space, the difficulty of the shot, and the goal of maximizing the chances of winning.

PickPocket is based on the traditional search framework, familiar from games such as chess, adapted to the continuous stochastic domain of billiards.

abstract = {Due to the rapid development of computer and information technology, 3D modeling and rendering capabilities are becoming increasingly important in many applications, including industrial design, architecture, CAD/CAM, video games, and medical imaging. Since 3D mesh models often have huge amounts of the data, it is time-consuming to retrieve front a storage device or to download from the network. Most 3D viewing applications need to obtain the entire file of a 3D model in order to display the model, even when the user is interested only in a low-resolution version of the model. Therefore, progressive coding that enables multiresolution transmission of 3D models is desired. In this paper, we propose the progressive coding scheme of 3D meshes with texture, in which we convert irregular meshes to semi-regular using texture coordinates, map them on planes, and apply 2D image coding algorithm to mesh compression. As our method uses the wavelet transform, the encoded bitstream has a progressive nature. We gain high compression rate with the same visual quality as original models.},

What makes the game analytically interesting is the creation of a game-world designed to promote a feeling of uncertainty in the player. This article explores the ways in which the ambience of uncertainty is developed within the game. Freud's writing on the uncanny and Kristeva's closely related work on abjection is drawn upon to explore how the game works rhetorically to place the player in an unsettled psychological state. The article argues that the use of the heavily gendered symbolism of the uncanny and the abject is value laden and that consequently we must pay attention to that which we cast out, reject, repress, and destroy in the fictive universe of video game play. The article concludes by suggesting that texts such as F.E.A.R. may resonate with wider uncertainties around the self in late-modern life.},

abstract = {Video games are virtual worlds, each with its own, distinctive spatiality. This paper suggests that there are two interrelated conceptual dimensions to the study of video games. First, there are the representational issues concerning the worlds depicted in video games, such as those portraying hypersexualized women or Orientalist depictions of Arab enemies. We suggest, however, that these cultural, sexual, and political representations are not the only forces doing work on the player within the virtual world of a video game. This paper complements a purely representational approach by considering \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}affect\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} as a precognitive force which disrupts and delights the player with reactions ranging from fear to joy. We argue that, as the spatiality of video games has evolved from simple two-dimensional to complex three-dimensional worlds; the importance of an affective experience to the player has become paramount. Exploiting and manipulating the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s sensory experience is now the central strategy for many game designers. The paper is divided in two interrelated sections: the first tackles representational issues from culture to violence, while the second section contributes to our understanding of video games as \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}worlds of affect\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}.},

@article{Teixeira2008,
abstract = {This essay seeks to reflect on some differences that should be established between the concepts of ‘ergodic gameplay’ and ‘narrative fiction’, on the basis of the categories of ‘simulation’ and ‘representation’. As in similar cases, early research in this field (which has developed as one of the research vectors of ludology criticism since the late nineties) considers the study of games in the context of existing theories, namely, those of narratology. This situation is perplexing to the extent that while the study of games dates 40 years back, that of narratives is much older, having been inaugurated with Aristotle’s Poetics, and thus exercising considerable influence in Western culture. However, if there are games in which ‘narrative’ composition is obvious (as is the case, for example, of great part of adventure games), the latter is (clearly) replaced by ‘gameplay’ composition and by the mechanisms of (pure) simulation in other games. For instance, the (imagetic) ‘representation’ of London should not be conflated with the (machinical) ‘simulation’ of Sim City, due to obeying a model that includes ‘rules’ (of behaviour). In effect, the category of ergodic simulation, or ‘gameplay’, allows for new forms of experience/construction of mediation/immersion to take place. We may thus draw closer, ludically and machinically, to the other side of the mirror/screen (distinct from mirror/paper) into which we, in the wake of Alice, often heteronymically transform ourselves.},

abstract = {Experimental research in business and economics has exploded in recent years in both laboratory and field settings. The generality of findings from field experiments is limited by the specificity of the experimental environment. Laboratory studies, on the other hand, are criticized for being devoid of the contextual cues that may indicate to decision makers the nature of the problem and, thus, the appropriate approaches to problem solving. Virtual experiments provide a hybrid of strengths from each of these two experimental protocols that may overcome some of the limitations of each. Using a modified, commercial, adventure game with an appended Sequel database, this research reprises a well-known study of risk aversion within a virtual context. The results indicate that very similar overall measures of risk aversion can be obtained within an adventure game context. Furthermore, it shows that experimentation within this virtual environment permits outcomes to be recorded and analyzed regarding decision consistency, decision revisions, and psychological/behavioral variables that have not been available using either traditional lab or field research methods. As such, this study contributes both to the literature on behavioral business research methodology in general and to the literature on risk aversion in particular. \~{}},

These three elements can be regarded as different classes of semiotic systems, or systems of meaning, having their own structuring principles and methods of informing experience. For any particular ludic system, such as a computer game, time structure can be considered in terms of a number of distinct layers of meaning analogous to the levels of encoding identified in structuralist narrative theory: a generation level, a simulation level, a performance level and a discourse level. The simulation, performance and discourse levels correspond to the semiotic domains of simulations, games and narratives. For any specific ludic system, the overall design approach relating to how the designer intends the players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} experience to be structured, as the core of interactive engagement and immersion, can be based upon emphasizing one of these three primary forms, or integrating more than one form by various strategies. Adopting a structural semiotic approach to modeling these layers of meaning provides a foundation for more clearly integrating design choices within a coherent overall concept, as well as laying the foundations for a more systematic study of possible correlations between design features and player affects.},

abstract = {Schema theory provides a foundation for the analysis of game play patterns created by players during their interaction with a game. Schema models derived from the analysis of play provide a rich explanatory framework for the cognitive processes underlying game play, as well as detailed hypotheses for the hierarchical structure of pleasures and rewards motivating players. Game engagement is accounted for as a process of schema selection or development, while immersion is explained in terms of levels of attentional demand in schema execution. However, schemas may not only be used to describe play, but might be used actively as cognitive models within a game engine. Predesigned schema models are knowledge representations constituting anticipated or desired learned cognitive outcomes of play. Automated analysis of player schemas and comparison with predesigned target schemas can provide a foundation for a game engine adapting or tuning game mechanics to achieve specific effects of engagement, immersion, and cognitive skill acquisition by players. Hence, schema models may enhance the play experience as well as provide a foundation for achieving explicitly represented pedagogical or therapeutic functions of games.},

abstract = {Computer technology has ushered in a new era of mass media, bringing with it great promise and great concerns about the effect on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s development and wellbeing. Although we tend to see these issues as being new, similar promises and concerns have accompanied each new wave of media technology throughout the past century: films in the early 1900s, radio in the 1920s, and television in the 1940s. With the introduction of each of these technologies, proponents touted the educational benefits for children, while opponents voiced fears about exposure to inappropriate commercial, sexual, and violent content. This article places current studies on children and computers in a historical context, noting the recurrent themes and patterns in media research during the twentieth century. Initial research concerning each innovation has tended to focus on issues of access and the amount of time children were spending with the new medium. As use of the technology became more prevalent, research shifted to issues related to content and its effects on children. Current research on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s use of computers is again following this pattern. But the increased level of interactivity now possible with computer games and with the communication features of die Internet has heightened both the promise of greatly enriched learning and the concerns related to increased risk of harm. As a result, research on die effects of exposure to various types of content has taken on a new sense of urgency The authors conclude that to help inform and sustain die creation of more quality content for children, further research is needed on the effects of media on children, and new partnerships must be forged between industry, academia, and advocacy groups.},

The game framework and engine of Fathammer is reused by partner companies that in turn produce game assets to be reused by Fathammer while developing games for various devices. Very rapid development of games is a necessity for Fathammer, whereas maintainability of games is not important.

Subjects were 861 German secondary-school children (mean age = 14.67; range 10-20 years). Latent class analysis with the data of a computer-game preference scale revealed three types of players: "non-players", "action-and-simulation game players" and "logic-and-skill-training game players". Large gender differences were found with respect to class assignment. More females than males were found in the "logic-and-skill-training game player" class (82.9\%) and in the class of "non-players" (81.9\%). Males in contrast were overrepresented (81.7\%) in the class of "action-and-simulation game players". As expected, males on average outperformed females in mental-rotation test performance (d = 0.63). Furthermore, ANOVA results indicated mean differences in mental-rotation ability between action-and-simulation players and non-players (partial eta(2) = .01) as well as age differences (partial eta(2) =.04). With boys, non-players on average had lower MRT scores than action-and-simulation game players. For females, computer-game preference was unrelated to MRT performance. Results are discussed within a nature-nurture-interactionist framework of gender differences in spatial abilities.},

The second part considers the studies that use adaptation strategies in controlling multiple agents based on probabilistic methods. Specifically we investigated (1) how probabilistic method is used to reorganize generate group (flocking) behaviors, and (2) how adaptation at the individual level is used to make multiple agents respond to obstacles in the environment.

abstract = {Online learning in commercial computer games allows computer-controlled opponents to adapt to the way the game is being played. As such it provides a mechanism to deal with weaknesses in the game AI, and to respond to changes in human player tactics. We argue that online learning of game AI should meet four computational and four functional requirements. The computational requirements are speed, effectiveness, robustness and efficiency. The functional requirements are clarity, variety, consistency and scalability. This paper investigates a novel online learning technique for game AI called \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}dynamic scripting\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, that uses an adaptive rulebase for the generation of game AI on the fly. The performance of dynamic scripting is evaluated in experiments in which adaptive agents are pitted against a collection of manually-designed tactics in a simulated computer roleplaying game. Experimental results indicate that dynamic scripting succeeds in endowing computer-controlled opponents with adaptive performance. To further improve the dynamic-scripting technique, an enhancement is investigated that allows scaling of the difficulty level of the game AI to the human player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s skill level. With the enhancement, dynamic scripting meets all computational and functional requirements. The applicability of dynamic scripting in state-of-the-art commercial games is demonstrated by implementing the technique in the game NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. We conclude that dynamic scripting can be successfully applied to the online adaptation of game AI in commercial computer games.},

abstract = {Real-time control of three-dimensional avatars is an important problem in the context of computer games and virtual environments. Avatar animation and control is difficult, however, because a large repertoire of avatar behaviors must be made available, and the user must be able to select from this set of behaviors, possibly with a low-dimensional input device. One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for fle xibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach through four different applications and compare the avatar motion to directly recorded human motion.},

This paper presents a system for user-controlled actions that aims at simplicity and ease of use while being enhanced by modern animation techniques to produce rich and complex behaviour. We use inverse kinematics based motion adaptation to make pre-existing pieces of motion apply to new targets. The expressiveness of the character is enhanced by adding autonomous behaviour, in this case eye gaze behaviour. This behaviour is generated autonomously but is still influenced by the actions that the user is requesting the character to perform. The actions themselves are simple for a designer with no programming experience to design and for an end user to customise. They are also very simple to invoke.},

@inproceedings{Garris2001,
abstract = {A shift in military training is underway from a traditional emphasis on classroom instruction to a more learner-centric model of training. In this approach, where training may be delivered "anytime, anywhere," trainees are often dispersed, and there is a greater responsibility on the learner to maintain motivation for his or her own learning. Although instructional games can provide a learning environment that actively engages the learner, this remains a relatively new instructional technology with limited empirical support. 

Several studies have examined the effects of game-based instructional programs on learning. For example, both Whitehall and McDonald (1993) and Ricci, Salas, and Cannon-Bowers (1996) found that instruction incorporating game features led to improved learning. In addition, Ricci, et. al (1996) proposed that instruction that incorporated game features enhanced student motivation, which led to greater attention to training content and greater retention. 

There is an implicit model of learning that is inherent in these studies. First, the goal is to design an instructional program that incorporates certain features or characteristics of games. Second, these features trigger a game cycle, a repeating cycle of user judgments, behavior, and feedback that characterizes the game player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s self-motivated engagement and task persistence (Garris, Ahlers, and Driskell, 2001). To the extent that training designers are successful in pairing instructional content with appropriate game features, this engagement in game play leads to the achievement of training objectives and specific learning outcomes. 

Although many have noted the potential benefits that may be gained from incorporating game characteristics into instructional applications, there is clearly little consensus regarding what the essential characteristics are and how they should be implemented. Based on a review of the literature about games, motivational training, and motivation-related constructs, we synthesized a model of motivational training using game features and predicted training and motivation outcomes. In this paper, we describe essential game features, how they were implemented for this research, and report a subset of the results of an empirical study to assess the effectiveness of a game-based trainer to enhance submarine technical skills and the effects of the training approach on student motivation. Bottom Gun, a game-based periscope trainer developed in support of this research, is a simulation-based game that incorporates simulated contacts, a high rate of interactivity, scoring, and visual and sound effects. The control training condition provided the same contacts within the same scenarios minus the game characteristics. 

The proposed approach to designing and evaluating the effectiveness of games was generally supported. Despite holding training objectives and content constant, Bottom Gun was perceived as more game-like than the control condition. Results indicated that both training conditions resulted in significant improvements in accuracy in calling angle-on-the-bow, a difficult visual perception task. However, the game-based training resulted in smaller visual estimation errors than the control training condition. Additionally, four context-specific measures of components of motivation, including locus of control, self-efficacy, valence, and goal commitment were found to have shifted in a positive direction at the post-test.

@article{4239,
abstract = {The term "mobile culture" reflects a phenomenal role that mobile devices play in our everyday lives. Accordingly, in the eyes of many current students, computing technology is associated with their mobile phones and gadgets instead of larger desktops that are commonly used in the academic environment. Most of them carry mobile phones with them at all times, and being able to develop and immediately run an application on their phone may offer an experience that is as practical and as close to the real world as it gets. By using mobile computing and, in particular, mobile game development, it may be possible to make course material more relevant to students; this also may show a stronger connection to real-world applications and technology that surround our students.To better understand the role of mobile culture and mobile phones in the life of contemporary students, we surveyed a group of 251 undergraduates, which included 117 females and 134 mates, between 18 and 25 years of age. 100\% of respondents said that they have a mobile phone. 49\% of males and 47\% of females said that they regularly play mobile games; on average they did that on 3.3 days each week. Students were asked to name three different places where they are most likely to play a mobile game. Answers included being at home (41\%) with nothing else to do, in class (39\%) during a lecture or another boring activity, in some form of transport (16\%), at the airport or on a plane, at work (15\%) and apparently not working, while waiting (14\%) for an appointment (e.g. at a doctor\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s office), at school (9\%) between classes, and others. We also asked to name three games that students play most frequently on their mobile phones. Out of 72 games that were mentioned, Tertis, Pacman and Solitaire were the three most popular, while over 40 other games were named only once. There was an approximately equal ratio between males and females who play the top three games. All of the top ten mobile games played by our respondents belong to the class of casual games. Such games are typically played in short bursts of time; their rules are simple, and unlike many desktop or console games, they do not require any major time commitment or any special skills. Most notably, many studies indicate that the demographics of mobile gamers are split equally between the two sexes.Compared to traditional computer games, introduction of mobile game development into Computer Science curricula received relatively little attention. There are very few reports about leveraging the appeal and relative simplicity of mobile game development to increase student interest in pursuing a degree in computing. Compared to desktop or console game development, mobile games are significantly less complex due to their simplified gameplay, smaller scale, simpler graphics, and other factors. In many ways, it may be easier to adopt mobile game development in the Computer Science curriculum than traditional game development while offering additional motivational benefits for students.Traditional game development has become a popular motivational tool; however, it is most effective for students who have already advanced down the course pipeline. In contrast, a playable mobile game could be successfully developed even in an introductory Computer Science course and thus provide a satisfying result to students eager to see tangible outcomes of their projects. Mobile computing can give students a sense of instant gratification - they can quickly compile a working graphical application and play the resulting game on their own mobile device and proudly show it off to their friends.Mobile game development is well positioned to address the challenges of its adoption to the curriculum. Because of a relative simplicity and a smaller scale, a playable mobile game can be developed within reasonable time by many CS students even with limited programming skills. Challenges of developing user interfaces for mobile devices can be a good topic for an in-depth discussion in a human-computer interactions course; overcoming connectivity and security issues could provide a good study framework in a computer networks course; while mobile-specific development issues are a good topic for a software engineering course. Mobile games can help broaden the horizons and motivate many students in introductory computing courses by exposing them to a variety of advanced topics early in the curriculum.As our survey shows, whether we like it or not, students do play games on their mobile phones and mobile gaming is here to stay. It is up to us, however, to use this situation for the benefit of Computer Science education and turn mobile gaming from a disruptive technology into a motivational tool.},

abstract = {Virtual environments are synthetic 3D worlds typically viewed from a first-person point of view with many potential applications within areas such as visualisation, entertainment and training simulators. To effectively develop and utilise virtual environments, user-centric evaluations are commonly performed. Anecdotal evidence suggests that factors such as prior experience with computer games may affect the results of such evaluations.This paper examines the effects of previous computer gaming experience, user perceived gaming ability and actual gaming performance on navigation tasks in a virtual environment. Two computer games and a virtual environment were developed to elicit performance metrics for use within a user study. Results indicated that perceived gaming skill and progress in a First-Person-Shooter (FPS) game were the most consistent metrics showing significant correlations with performance in time-based navigation tasks. There was also strong evidence that these relations were significantly intensified by the inclusion of participants who play FPS games. In addition, it was found that increased gaming experience decreased spatial perception performance.},

abstract = {Purpose - Aims to determine how multiple play styles and use of \&quot;outside\&quot; materials can be successfully taken into account when designing user experiences in educational digital games. Design/methodology/approach - This research draws on over two dozen qualitative interviews and an open-ended survey of an additional 50 game players with a wide range of gameplay experience. Findings - Findings suggest that players have different skill sets, and different beliefs about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable help in a variety of games. These findings are analyzed to argue for different ways to enhance the educational gaming experience for players. Research limitations/implications - As with all qualitative research, the relatively small sample size makes it difficult to draw broad generalizations from the data. However, the research does suggest that there are many ways to play games, that players use many items and information \&quot;outside\&quot; the game to help them play or enhance their experience, and such things can be fruitfully used to improve educational games. Practical implications - Designers of educational games should take into account the materials surrounding games, such as walkthroughs and codes, as ways to enhance the game and educational experience, rather than detract from them. Originality/value - Very little research has been done examining how players perceive items and information related to game play, as well as how they use such things. This research investigates that area and relates the knowledge to ways to improve educational games, and education.

The functionality and the physical elements of a traditional board game and the calculation performance of a computer simulation model were combined in the new multiplayer interface concept. The operations of players are mediated to the computer through the game board elements, not through the standard input devices of the computer. The key usability targets of the user interface have been also identified. Based on very early findings the developed multiplayer interface seems to support the usability targets in terms of naturalness and collaboration. The conventional arrangement with the digital multiplayer simulation games is the user interface, where each player has their own keyboard and visual display. This study introduces new possibility for game designers to integrate a traditional board game concept and a computer simulation model to enhance collaboration and learning in gaming.},

Methods: 1,039 South Australian children aged 10-13 years old completed a multimedia 24-hour activity recall diary on 2-4 occasions in 2002, including at least one school day and one non-school day. Results: The median screen time was 229 minutes.d(-1). This was higher in boys (264 vs. 196 minutes; p < 0.001) and on non-school days (260 vs. 190 minutes; p < 0.001), increased with age (p=0.003), and decreased with socio-economic status (SES; p=0.003). Television consumed 73\% of all screen time, video games 19\%, non-game computer use 6\%, and cinema 2\%. The top quartile of screen users were more likely to be boys (OR=3.8), have low physical activity (OR=4.3), spend > 25\% of screen time playing video games (OR=1.8), sleep less, and be of lower SES. Conclusions and Implications: Interventions to reduce screen time should target inactive, low-SES boys, encourage earlier bedtimes, and limit video game use.},

Dutch adolescent boys with low education ability (N=112) were randomly assigned to play a realistic or fantasy violent or nonviolent video game. Next, they competed with an ostensible partner on a reaction time task in which the winner could blast the loser with loud noise through headphones (the aggression measure). Participants were told that high noise levels could cause permanent hearing damage. Habitual video game exposure, trait aggressiveness, and sensation seeking were controlled for. As expected, the most aggressive participants were those who played a violent game and wished they were like a violent character in the game. These participants used noise levels loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage to their partners, even though their partners had not provoked them. These results show that identifying with violent video game characters makes players more aggressive. Players were especially likely to identify with violent characters in realistic games and with games they felt immersed in.},

Furthermore, it is argued that the relationship between player and sound is best conceptualized theoretically as an acoustic ecology.

abstract = {Fundamental concepts and definitions of electronic learning (eLearning) continue to emerge, and theories of eLearning that have been advanced thus far cover an array of academic perspectives including training and education, learning and knowledge, and technology and applications to specific market segments. Any study of the effectiveness and efficiency of eLearning, therefore, has to address a variety of issues, including the role of eLearning in knowledge and learning, its contribution to competent performance, its relationship to organizational transformation, and strategies for embedding it into other forms of electronic interaction. eLearning refers to a form of learning in which the instructor and student are physically separated by space or time, and the gap between the two is bridged through the use of online technologies. Virtual technology utilizes an interactive approach to computer-based learning by providing real-time feedback to the user. Surveys of manufacturing companies have verified their interest and enthusiasm in the potential of virtual technology for industrial applications; however, the companies noted that one of the barriers to investing in the technology is the need for a structured methodology to guide the application identification, as well as the model building and evaluation for this technology. The study referenced in this article addresses this need by providing a framework for the development of a virtual environment that provides information for manufacturing task completion. It builds upon extant research into the use of virtual reality for task completion as well as proposes a structure for virtual environment development.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data obtained during supine rest, in response to and recovery from four laboratory stressors in a baseline year were used to predict supine resting BP and HR values obtained during each of four consecutive annual follow-up evaluations. Subjects were 385 normotensive youth (mean age 12.7 +/- 2.6 at baseline year) with a positive family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). During the baseline evaluation subjects were presented with four laboratory stressors (namely, postural change, video game challenge, social competence interview, and parent-child conflict discussion). The BP and HR values taken during each of the laboratory stressors and during the post stressor recovery periods were converted to z-scores which were averaged to yield aggregate measures for systolic and diastolic BP and HR responsivity and recovery. The data obtained during the baseline evaluation were subsequently used to predict the follow-up values of supine resting BP and HR. The prediction models were fairly consistent across each of the 4 follow-up years. Responsivity or recovery accounted for up to 6\% of the total variance after accounting for baseline values. Within the prediction models responsivity or recovery accounted for 4-56\% of the variance. The predictive value of the derived models did not decline from one annual evaluation to the next over the length of the study. CV recovery may supplement resting and responsivity in the prediction of future development of CVD.},

abstract = {Objectives: To test whether the results of the accumulated studies on media violence and aggressive behavior are consistent with the theories that have evolved to explain the effects. We tested for the existence of both short-term and long-term effects for aggressive behavior. We also tested the theory-driven hypothesis that short-term effects should be greater for adults and long-term effects should be greater for children. Design: Meta-analysis. Participants: Children younger than 18 years and adults. Main Exposures: Violent media, including TV, movies, video games, music, and comic books. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (eg, heart rate, blood pressure), and helping behavior. Results: Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the theory that short- term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well-encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs, which adults have had more time to encode. In contrast, long-term effects require the learning (encoding) of scripts, schemas, or beliefs. Children can encode new scripts, schemas, and beliefs via observational learning with less interference and effort than adults.},

We focused on gender-related aspects of gaming in a study of 206 college students. Men were significantly more likely than women to play video games two or more hours a week and to indicate that video game playing interfered with sleeping and with class preparation. A greater proportion of women than men complained about the amount of time their significant other played video games. Participants rated female video game characters as significantly more helpless and sexually provocative than male characters and as less likely to be strong and aggressive. Gender differences in participation and character portrayals potentially impact the lives of youth in a variety of ways.

abstract = {Recently, toolkits for user innovation and design have been proposed as a promising means of opening up the innovation process to customers. Using these tools, customers can take on problem-solving tasks and design products to fit their individual needs. To date, arguments in favor of this new concept have been limited to the idea of satisfying each user\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s needs in a highly efficient and valuable way. The aim of this empirical study is to extend our knowledge of how users deal with \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}the invitation to innovate\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and how attractive individual user designs might be to other users. In studying the users of toolkits for the immensely popular computer game The Sims, we found that (1) users are not \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}one-time shoppers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} \{$\backslash$textendash\} in fact, their innovative engagement is rather long-lasting, continuous, evolving, and intense. We also found that (2) leading-edge users do not merely content themselves with the official toolkits provided by the manufacturer. They employ user-created tools to push design possibilities even further. (3) Moreover, individual user designs are not only attractive to the creators themselves; instead, certain innovative solutions are in high demand among other users. Based on our findings, we discuss how toolkits and their users might add to the process of innovation in general. We argue that toolkits could serve as a promising market research tool for guiding a firm\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s new product development efforts. Furthermore, toolkits may serve as a creche for interested but inexperienced users who could evolve into leading-edge users over time. These innovative users might then be integrated into more radical product development efforts.},

In addition to making calls, mobile phones are associated with various additional services and games, which are becoming part of everyday life. As the location of mobile phones can be precisely tracked in space, they can be used for investigating the space-time behaviour of society. In this paper we will introduce the Social Positioning Method and its possible applications in the organisation and planning of public life. The Social Positioning Method (SPM) studies social flows in time and space by analysing the location coordinates of mobile phones and the social identification of the people carrying them. So far, relatively few SPM surveys have been carried out-the reason for that is related to people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s anxieties about the idea of being tracked, as well as technical aspects. In this article we assert that SPM will become very wide-spread in the future and will fundamentally change public life and administration. Due to the widespread use of telephones and the possibilities of social positioning, the questions of privacy and freedom of the individual are already being discussed. Despite this, there has still been only a limited discussion concerning live-map geography and real-time planning in relation to privacy issues. },

abstract = {In the last few years the importance of multiplayer games has seen an immense growth. On par with that, the virtual environments (VEs) increased in their size. Today there exist more than 120 MMOGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Games) ranging from FPS (first person shooter) to classic RPG (role playing game) settings. Such an evolution leads to the fact that players start to \&quot;live\&quot; in a virtual world. Thus each player at least partially merges with his character (playing figure) and acts in the virtual world. Nevertheless there can be huge gaps between ones real and virtual behavior. This paper uses a well balanced set of questions based on the psychological big5 model to show the mentioned gaps between real world and virtual world attitude. The underlying online survey models 30 selected questions about online and real world behavior. The results are stored in a database in order to statistically interpret them afterwards. The analysis includes correlations between deterministic values (such as age, nationality and gender) and traits of the big5 model (like surgery, emotional stability and conscientiousness). Furthermore it contains other surprising conclusions about the difference in behavior.

abstract = {Activity Theory supports the idea that human activity is hierarchically organized. Our research follows a qualitative case study that highlights the use of affordances, or potentials for action, during video game player interaction among peers and the game interface. Activity Theory\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s meditational triangle will shed light on motivated activity itself, the tools available to complete the activity, and peer relationships (such as role specialization and rules of interaction) to evaluate game designs and their ability to fulfill serious purposes with meaningful outcomes. This presentation will focus on Activity Theory and how the meditational triangle can be used to evaluate peer relationships within game play.

A blended approach incorporating features of Ethnomethodology and grounded theory will be used to construct an open-ended, bottom-up approach to studying collaborative game play. A true Ethnomethodological approach would reject the top-down, theory-driven approach required by Activity Theory, Activity Theory can highlight particular relationships during game player interactions to provide a frame for game player activity. Activity theory, when applied in conjunction with an emergent approach, can both broaden our concept of affordances and remind us to look for action potentials on the various levels of activity, and does not necessarily have to constrain findings by introducing preconceptions. While bound to the specific situation being studied and not seeking of patterns in observations, Ethnomethodology can be a very useful starting point for the analysis of game player activity in order to reveal underlying, and commonly overlooked, social assumptions.

Activity theory can be incorporated following an initially open-ended, emergent Ethnomethodological approach to highlight relationships and game player motivations that might have been initially overlooked. While this process becomes partially theory-driven in the end, it also allows us to obtain some of the benefits of initially using an open-ended ethnomethodologically inspired approach. This approach can help construct a context-dependent, bottom-up, indexical and descriptive representation of game player activity, which is crucial to understanding interactions within Serious Games and their associated meaningful outcomes.},

abstract = {An ex post facto exploratory case study was conducted at ABC University to examine the
difference in academic achievement between students who use video games in learning and those
who do not, while also looking at differences of gender, ethnicity, and age. A video game was
added to half the classes teaching management to 3rd year students. Identical testing situations
and materials were used while data collected included who did and did not play the game,
student test scores, class number, gender, ethnicity, and age. Means tests, ANOVA, Chi-squared,
and t tests were used to test the effectiveness of game use.
Classes using the game scored significantly higher means those classes that did not.
There were no significant differences between genders, while both genders scored significantly
higher with game play. There were no significant differences between ethnicities, while all
ethnic groups scored significantly higher with game play. However, students 40 years and below
scored significantly higher with game play, while students 41 and older did not.
The implications for social change are enormous. Such dramatic increases in student
learning could lead to simulation and games as standard teaching tools in most curriculum areas.
If game-based learning further proves to increase learning as shown in this study, America\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s
educational system faces a revolution in learning.},

@article{Browne2005,
abstract = {There is continuing debate on the extent of the effects of media violence on children and young people, and how to investigate these effects. The aim of this review is to consider the research evidence from a public-health perspective. A search of published work revealed five meta-analytic reviews and one quasi-systematic review, all of which were from North America. There is consistent evidence that violent imagery in television, film and video, and computer games has substantial short-term effects on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, increasing the likelihood of aggressive or fearful behaviour in younger children, especially in boys. The evidence becomes inconsistent when considering older children and teenagers, and long-term outcomes for all ages. The multifactorial nature of aggression is emphasised, together with the methodological difficulties of showing causation. Nevertheless, a small but significant association is shown in the research, with an effect size that has a substantial effect on public health. By Contrast, only weak evidence from correlation studies links media violence directly to crime.},

abstract = {Associations between demographic characteristics, school schedules, activity choices, family functioning, and sleep behaviors were estimated using, nationally representative time-diary data from 2,454 children (ages 5.5 to 11.9 years) and adolescents (ages 12.0 to 19.1 years). For weekdays, African American adolescents, Asian children, and those with earlier school start times and longer travel times to school reported fewer sleep hours. More time spent watching television (for children), doing homework (for adolescents), and engaging in religious activities predicted fewer hours, whereas a longer time spent on meals predicted greater hours of weekday sleep. For younger children, greater parental warmth predicted more hours of weekday sleep, whereas for adolescents, stricter household rules were protective. On weekends, African American adolescents and Hispanic children slept less, and there were strong effects of activity choices including time spent on television, computer and video-games, sports, religious activities, socializing, and employment. In accounting for age-related decreases in sleep hours from childhood to adolescence, earlier school start times, greater hours of homework, greater paid employment, less time spent on meals, and fewer household rules were all significant mediators.

However, games usually differ on more variables than just the displayed violence, so the question whether the determined effects can be traced back to violent content only remains unanswered. One very obvious difference between first-person shooters and other digital games is the speed of gameplay.
We present an experiment in which participants play a modified version of a latest-generation first-person shooter in one of four conditions (A: high vs. normal speed, B: high vs. low violence). Physiological arousal is measured through conductive skin response, heart rate, force applied on mouse and keyboard, and body movement. Aggressive behavior measurements are taken through the Competitive Reaction Time Test.},

Thirty children 10-14 years old who played video games in their leisure time participated in this controlled study. The sample included children with Learning Disabilities and ADHD. Measures of auditory memory, attention, and planning, as well as beta and theta activity in the brain, were collected as pre- and posttest measures. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental group played video games for 1 h, while participants in the control group played card or board games for 1 h. Pre- and post-test difference scores were analyzed according to group for variations between groups. No significant differences were noted on MANOVAs. When children in this sample engaged in video game play with mildly rated (E for Everyone) recreational video games without blood, gore, and carnage for a limited time (60 min), beta and theta activity and ability to perform certain neuropsychological tasks did not appear to be disrupted.

abstract = {This article from the example of videogames for girls to other aspects of designing technology for women, it is instructive to apply McIntosh\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s model to the design of technology. We have left phase one behind: no longer is it possible to build womanless technology. Currently, there is widespread recognition of the importance of taking gender into account in interface design (witness the presence of this chapter in a handbook on HCI). And we have passed through phase two: public perception of the role of women in technology has changed radically, due to the efforts of activist computer scientists and historians who have highlighted, among others, Ada Lovelace\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s seminal role in the birth of the computer, and Grace Hopper\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s essential contribution to computing. Now, however, we find ourselves at a stage where women seem to pose some kind of problem for the design of technology. Tech companies pay consultants to help them figure out how to design for women. One gender and technology consulting firm refers to its ability to help companies succeed at "the notoriously selective and lucrative demographic of teenage girls." A consultant for online businesses advertises its knowledge of "what makes women click": a six-step program from initiating the relationship through subtle tactics of banner and home page design, through deepening the relationship by asking motivating survey questions. The goal is "the inside tract to get inside women\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s minds and keep them inside" the website. In fact, many websites for women have sprung up, but the majority treat the same topics as women\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s magazines that have been around for hundreds of years (the banner on one women\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s website invites readers to learn about "Making your home a haven for your family")},

Therefore, an online questionnaire survey was used to examine various factors of online computer game players (n = 540) who played the most popular online game Everquest. The survey examined basic demographic information, playing frequency (i.e. amount of time spent playing the game a week), playing history (i.e. how long they had been playing the game, who they played the game with, whether they had ever gender swapped their game character, the favourite and least favourite aspects of playing the game, and what they sacrifice (if anything) to play the game. Results showed that adolescent gamers were significantly more likely to be male, significantly less likely to gender swap their characters, and significantly more likely to sacrifice their education or work. In relation to favourite aspects of game play, the biggest difference between the groups was that significantly more adolescents than adults claimed their favourite aspect of playing was violence. Results also showed that in general, the younger the player, the longer they spent each week playing.},

abstract = {Debate regarding the psychological and behavioural effects of playing violent video games has recently led to claims that violent video games increase aggression effects in adolescents, and that this issue has now been settled. However, other researchers have found either no detrimental effects from game playing or even positive (cathartic) effects. In this research we demonstrate that these different conclusions are not mutually exclusive and can be explained by the method of assessment and analytic techniques utilised. We had adolescents play a violent video game (Quake II) and took measurements of anger both before, during and after game play. The results demonstrated that some people increase, some decrease and the majority show no change in anger ratings. Unlike past research, we also demonstrate that these changes are mediated by the player\&\#39;s feelings immediately prior to game play and a labile temperament - one predisposed to aggression - and that these variables predict people\&\#39;s reactions with an average 73\% concordance rate.

abstract = {Interactive generation of reactive motions for virtual humans as they are hit, pushed and pulled are very important to many applications, such as computer games. In this paper, we propose a new method to simulate reactive motions during arbitrary bipedal activities, such as standing, walking or running. It is based on momentum based inverse kinematics and motion blending. When generating the animation, the user first imports the primary motion to which the perturbation is to be applied to. According to the condition of the impact, the system selects a reactive motion from the database of pre-captured stepping and reactive motions. It then blends the selected motion into the primary motion using momentum-based inverse kinematics. Since the reactive motions can be edited in real-time, the criteria for motion search can be much relaxed than previous methods, and therefore, the computational cost for motion search can be reduced. Using our method, it is possible to generate reactive motions by applying external perturbations to the characters at arbitrary moment while they are performing some actions.},

Using a sample of year 3 and 5 pupils in three primary schools, qualitative and quantitative data were gathered. The results suggest that children make more use of the computer at home than at school. The most popular activity on the home computer which all children enjoyed was playing games. The most frequent activity at the school computer was word processing which pupils considered boring. Interesting gender differences showed that boys spent more lime playing computer games whereas girls spent more time on the Internet emailing friends. The study concludes that schools should learn from what works at home and enable children to work on activities they find valuable, motivational and worthwhile.},

It starts from the premise that aesthetic form, perhaps the central category of modernist critical theory, is present in our play with computer games. The central argument is that controllers and our use of them are repressed in gameplay and that this repression facilitates a diversion of the player’s energy that helps explain the compulsive nature of good games. Our sense of participation in events in game fiction is bought at the price of a loss of interest in our hands. The smooth integration of players into the rough, faltering world of gameplay is made possible by an excess of energy that passes from the unacknowledged tension in the hand into the imaginary relation we have with on-screen action.},

semantic contents and sequencing constructs it contains, and the behaviour and subjective experience of the player are combined into a more-or-less stable and effective state of being-in-theworld. Ludic reality directly addresses the question of the impact of internal, semantic factors in the experience, such as world, narrative and agency, together with the adoption, by the player, of a schematic, structured means of effectively interacting
with the system to draw out its specific systems of affordances and reward.},

By intentionally merging virtual and physical space, pervasive gaming not only extends the magic circle of play; it further challenges our conception of game rules, game mechanics, and game entities. This paper introduces and discusses some of the key characteristics of this novel trend in computer games. Following a short description of the significant features of pervasive computing, Walther explicates pervasive gaming in relation to time, space, and presence (or immersion). Then I position four axes or zones of pervasive gaming: mobility, distribution, persistence, and transmediality. Further, I describe and analyse three essential units of PG (rules, entities, and mechanics), and finally, I speculate about the role of space in PG by differentiating between tangible space, information space, and accessibility space.},

abstract = {Countless children and youth are exposed to gun violence each year--at home, at school, in their communities, or through the media. Gun violence can leave lasting emotional scars on these children. This article reviews research regarding the psychological effects of gun violence on children and youth, and offers suggestions for how parents, school administrators, and mental health workers can mitigate these negative effects.* Children exposed to gun violence may experience negative short- and long-term psychological effects, including anger, withdrawal, posttraumatic stress, and desensitization to violence. All of these outcomes can feed into a continuing cycle of violence.* Certain children may be at higher risk for negative outcomes if they are exposed to gun violence. Groups at risk include children injured in gun violence, those who witness violent acts at close proximity, those exposed to high levels of violence in their communities or schools, and those exposed to violent media.* Parents, school administrators, and mental health workers all can play key roles in protecting children from gun violence and helping them overcome the effects of gun-related trauma.The authors recommend a number of strategies that adults can adopt to help children cope with gun violence, such as increasing parental monitoring, targeting services to youth at risk of violent activity, and developing therapeutic interventions to help traumatized young people.Guns are deeply embedded in American society. Indeed, many people around the world perceive the gun as one of America\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s primary cultural icons--from Al Capone\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s machine gun to GI Joe\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s rifle, or more recently, the shotguns and assault rifles of young gang members and adolescent school shooters. An estimated 43\% of American households contain some type of gun. (l) Despite the prevalence of guns in the United States, an ongoing and intense cultural struggle continues regarding their proper place in society, particularly in the lives of children and youth. Most states have laws limiting minors\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} access to guns.

Samples of 27 adolescents aged 13-17 with Disruptive Behavior Disorder with Aggressive Features and 27 age-gender-IQ matched controls completed a semistructured interview about exposure to violence on television and video games; parents completed a corresponding questionnaire measure. Moderate intercorrelations were found between most self- and parent-report television and video game violence exposure measures. Compared to control adolescents, adolescents with Disruptive Behavior Disorder with Aggressive Features had higher aggregate media violence exposure, higher exposure to video game violence, and higher parent-reported exposure to television violence. Results show that adolescents and parents agree about the adolescent\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s level of media violence exposure, that exposure to violence on television tends to be accompanied by exposure to violence in video games, and that the association between media violence exposure and Disruptive Behavior Disorder with Aggressive Features is not due to a spurious effect of gender or IQ.},

abstract = {With the introduction of Nintendo video-games on a large scale, reports of children having seizures while playing suggested a possible specific, provocative factor. Although 50\% of the photosensitive patients are also sensitive to a 50-1-12 television, nonphotosensitive patients with a history of videogame seizures were described as well. The question arises whether this is a mere coincidence, provoked by fatigue and stress, is related to the reaction to the television screen itself, or depends on the movement and color of the pictures of this specific game. A European study was performed in four countries and five sites. All patients were selected because of a history of television, video- or computer-game seizures, with a history of sunlight-, discotheque-, or black and white pattern-evoked seizures, or were already known to be sensitive to intermittent photic stimulation. A total of 387 patients were investigated; 220 (75\%) were female and 214 (55\%) of those were <18 years of age. After a routine examination, intermittent photic, pattern, and television stimulation were performed in a standardized way. The patients were investigated with Super Mario World and a standard relatively nonprovocative TV program, both on a 50- and 100-Hz television. Regardless of the distance, Super Mario World proved to be more provocative than the standard program (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05), Eighty-five percent showed epi leptiform discharges evoked by intermittent photic stimulation. Forty-five percent of patients were 50-Hz television sensitive and 26\% were 100-Hz television sensitive. Pattern sensitivity was found in 28\% of patients. The patients, referred because of a television, video- or computer-game seizure, were significantly more sensitive to pattern and to the 50-Hz television (chi square, p < 0.001). More patients are sensitive when playing Super Mario, compared with the standard program (Wilcoxon, p = 0.001) and more sensitive with playing versus viewing (p = 0.016). Of the patients who were referred because of seizures in front of the television, or evoked by a video- or computer game, 14\% proved not to be photosensitive. Although no difference in age or use of medication was found, twice as many men were found in this nonphotosensitive group.},

But he just couldn\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}t bring himself to play the traditional career game. Instead, Komisar made up his own rules, taking a series of jobs that sparked his passions and made him happy-and successful.

But that was only after he\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}d worked his way through 11 companies in 25 years -a crazy quilt of jobs as a music promoter, corporate lawyer, CFO at a software start- up, and chief executive at a video game company, just to name a few. Komisar\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s success came by not having a career-at least, not in the traditional old-economy sense of the word. He realized there were alternatives to marching your way straight up the corporate ladder and that success in the new economy can involve a series of twists and turns. In this first-person account, Komisar describes why a nontraditional career path such as the one he unintentionally took may appeal to more businesspeople than might suspect it themselves. He tracks his professional journey along a sometimes tense, often enlightening, and ultimately prosperous course. He shares lessons learned along the way. Komisar also makes a strong business case for pursuing the passion-driven career; such a career, he says, makes supreme sense in the new economy because it\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s flexible and challenging - both for an individual and for the companies he chooses to work for.},

abstract = {Much of the current critical and theoretical literature on new media, including video and computer games, assumes both the conceptual transparency of the video or computer screen and the absolute authority of a rational scientific order. In keeping with these cultural prejudices, descriptions of the optical space of video games presume an uncomplicated optical scheme, founded on traditions of linear perspective. This can be seen with game designers, and game critics, treatment of video game perspective and point-of-view: video game spaces are understood to be the procedural outcomes of geometrically articulated orders derived from using program code and the physics of game engines.[2] But, video game spaces are more than simply the sum of their code - they are experiential spaces generated through code and the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s interaction with the execution of that code through the medium of the screen. Given this multifaceted experiential component of games, an uncritical conception of spatial phenomenology and the verisimilitude of linear perspective fails to explain how video games operate. Critical theory, theory which explains how the player operates both on the game space and within the game space, is needed. In this paper, I propose that the models of subjectivity and agency offered by psychoanalysis provide a way to investigate the relationship of the player, player-character and the screen. For this investigation, I specifically examine how perspective shapes the field of the gaze and the implications of that shaping.},

abstract = {This article constructs a new framework for the study of games as sites of social rationalization, applying Feenberg\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s critical theory of technology. We begin by making the case for a consideration of games as systems of social rationality, akin to other modern systems such as capitalist markets and bureaucratic organizations. We then present a conceptualization of play as a process through which the player focuses attention away from the undifferentiated action of everyday life toward a differentiated sphere of playful activity. This approach reveals how the experience of play changes as it becomes rationalized through the technological mediation and widespread standardization that occurs as games become large-scale social practices. We propose a theory of the rationalization of play (ludification), which outlines the key components of socially rationalized games, which we then apply to the specific example of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs).},

The real problem, however, is not with the virtual; it is with the real itself. This article investigates the undeniably useful but ultimately mistaken and somewhat misguided concept of the real that has been routinely operationalized in investigations of new media technology. The specific point of contact for the examination is the avatar. What is at issue here is not the complicated structures and articulations of avatar identity but the assumed real thing\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} that is said to be its ultimate cause and referent. In addressing this subject, the article considers three theories of the real, extending from Platonism to the recent innovations of Slavoj \{\v{Z}\}i\{\v{z}\}ek and investigates their effect on our understanding of computer-generated experience and social interaction.},

abstract = {Streaming real-time multimedia content over the Internet is gaining momentum in the communications, entertainment, music and interactive game industries as well as in the military. In general, streaming applications include IP telephony, multimedia broadcasts and various interactive applications such as multi-party conferences, collaborations and multiplayer games. Successfully realizing such applications in a highly mobile environment, however, presents many research challenges. In order to investigate such challenges and demonstrate viable solutions, we have developed an experimental indoor and outdoor testbed laboratory. By implementing standard IETF protocols into this testbed, we have demonstrated the basic functionalities required of the mobile wireless Internet to successfully support mobile multimedia access. These requirements include signaling, registration, dynamic configuration, mobility binding, location management, Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA), and quality of service over a variety of radio access network (RAN) technologies (e.g. 802.11b, CDMA/GPRS). In this paper, we describe this testbed and discuss important design issues and tradeoffs. We detail the incorporation and inter-relation of a wide catalog of IETF protocols-such as SIP, SAP, SDP, RTP/RTCP/RTSP, MGCP, variants of Mobile-IP, DRCP, HMMP, PANA, and DSNP-to achieve our goals. We believe that the results and experiences obtained from this experimental testbed will advance the understanding of the pertinent deployment issues for a Mobile Wireless Internet. },

It also elicited similar information about a smaller group, approximately four hundred strong, of year 10 (14-15-year-old) pupils including their reading of fiction and non-fiction. These further findings form the basis of this article and extend the inquiry to the reading of magazines and comics in years 8 and 10, the watching of television and the time spent in viewing videos and in playing computer games. The pattern of reading, showing the dominance of American teenage horror stories is similar to that of the year 8 group and the downward trend in the amount of both boys\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and girls\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} optional reading is confirmed, with a particular decline noted in the reading of books by year 10 boys. The marked difference between the nature of boys\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and girls\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} comics and magazines is noted. Whilst the amount of television viewing has remained fairly constant over several years, the nature of the viewing had changed greatly and some pupils-particularly boys-were spending a considerable amount of time in front of screens of various sorts in any one day.

Sixteen frequent-buyers of computer games identified 39 design features that appeal to buyers by contrasting different versions of Pacman games. Twenty-eight versions of Pacman were then evaluated in terms of the identified design features by 45 participants ( 27 male and 18 female college students). Qnet2000 neural network software was used to determine the relative importance of these design features. The results indicated that the top 10 most important design features could account for more than 50\% of "perceived fun" among these 39 design features. The feature of avatar is important to game-buyers, yet not revealed in previous player-oriented studies. Moreover, six design factors underlying the 39 features were identified through factor analysis. These factors included "novelty and powerfulness,""appealing presentation,""interactivity,""challenging,""sense of control," and " rewarding," and could account for 54\% of total variance. Among these six factors, appealing presentation has not been emphasized by player-oriented research. Implications of the findings were discussed.},

More recently there is a growing appreciation of the potential of computer games as a medium for learning. Such games were initially referred to as edutainment, although this is now a deprecated term and are nowadays referred to as games for learning or serious games. Indeed many people now believe that the games for learning industry is set to make a significant impact over the next decade with a wide variety of educational computer games being developed to support learning. Researchers have examined computer games from many different perspectives, some positive (for example, motivation, engagement, learning, skills development) and some negative (for example, violence, aggression, gender stereotyping). One particular type of game that has not been explored in detail for educational purposes is the Alternate Reality Game (ARG), a form of interactive narrative, often involving multiple media and game elements, to tell a story that may be affected by participants\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} ideas or actions. In this paper we describe the use of an ARG to help support the teaching and learning of modern foreign languages; by European secondary school children (ages 14-16).},

Most important, these critics often jail to recognize that variability exists at different levels of analysis and in the interactions: between players, between games, between contexts, and so forth. The simultaneous existence of both positive and negative consequences of electronic games can be elaborated and reconciled in part through a multilevel perspective on electronic game effects whereby important variables exist at the levels of the individual, game content, and societal time or space.

However, the case has largely been established through epidemiological studies with adults. Substantial attention has been paid to the activity levels of children and adolescents, largely because of changing lifestyles that have threatened the opportunity to be active and also introduced attractive sedentary alternatives such as playing computer games. The research evidence that children have become less active to the point where it is seriously damaging their current and future health has been difficult to establish. This situation is due to difficulties in establishing sensitive health risk markers, and also with the assessment of the different elements of physical activity which in children and adolescents is a complex profile of social behaviours. Self report of activity is unreliable with young children, and objective measures are required that are cheap and effective with large samples and that are capable of measuring levels, volume and patterns of physical activity. Accelerometry in combination with diaries offers the best current solution for most activity-health relationships, and for informing intervention need and design.},

abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this paper is to describe the potential of the videogame as a mass communication medium and to propose a videogame-based public outreach strategy for education and inspiration to space science and space activities. Design/methodology/approach - The objective was achieved by means of a semiotic approach to the medium under discussion. The subject scope of the paper was further developed and supported by an overview of existing case studies related to the topic. Based on the aforementioned analysis and on original ideas, new concepts and strategies on the subject are proposed. Findings - The videogame medium has excellent potential for promotion, marketing and educational applications. Moreover, spin-off applications in the field of simulation-based research can also be envisioned. The proposed concepts, although specifically referring to the space sector, are applicable to many other industrial and non-industrial fields, including libraries. Practical implications - The paper hints at many possible spin-off applications for videogames in the field of communication, marketing and simulation-based research. Originality/value - The concepts proposed in the paper outline novel marketing and outreach strategies (together with other spin-off applications) based on a rather underestimated medium, i.e. the videogame, which has yet to receive proper attention from scholars.},

abstract = {The emergence of pervasive technologies has led to an increased interest in both the design and the development of pervasive games. This paper presents ‘‘Them and Us’’, an indoor pervasive game which uses theatrical processes to encourage social interaction within the confines of the game. The ‘‘Them and Us’’ game play places a group of people together in a single space to interact with one another, whilst location-based technology informs us about the locative-nature (who, where and when) of the social interactions formed while in that space, in order to score points based on this interaction. ‘‘Them and Us’’ adopts a narrative-based approach in which a script informs the way that participants play the game and the way their social behaviour, in regard to this becomes part of the game mechanism. This new genre of interactive game-based artwork intertwines the physical and virtual contexts of the players in order to create new and exciting player experiences. The design of ‘‘Them and Us’’ emphasizes the use of tracking the audience and performers as a way to encourage interaction within the game-space},

However, the current trend towards embodied and social perspectives on interaction provides an alternative way of looking at interactive processes, instead emphasising aspects such as social and physical performance with and around technology. We have explored a range of activities and tools that explicitly address these aspects in programming, with a specific focus on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s making of own computer games and simulations. We exemplify this work through three different situations where tools and activities are used by children as recourses for building of interactive systems, while at the same time allowing for bodily action in negotiation of design ideas. We discuss how situations like these may provide directions for new technologies for programming as well as methodological developments in the area of interaction design.},

abstract = {This study proposes two cursor-capturing functions (jumping and gravity) in mouse operation. The jumping function is designed to move the cursor to a target instantaneously when the cursor reaches around it while the gravity function is designed to move the cursor to a target gradually. In an experiment conducted to examine their performance, target positioning time, accuracy, and subjective preference were measured and compared with the normal condition (i.e. with no function). The results showed that the gravity function had an advantage in positioning time and accuracy. In addition, the gravity function was preferred to the jumping and the normal condition. Benefits and drawbacks are discussed in using these functions for human-computer interaction. The cursor capturing functions are expected to help older users or novices in operating a mouse efficiently and easily. Relevance to industry The proposed technique can be applied to software applications such as computer games where target positioning is frequent or essential. It may also be used to ease target positioning in various situations, e.g., mobile devices, virtual environment or software for motion-impaired users.},

@phdthesis{Wilson2007a,
abstract = {This thesis examines early videogames in relation to a number of current and emerging topics in videogame aesthetics. 

The introduction outlines the approach to videogame history the thesis follows. It offers a periodisation of early games as those played during the period when arcades were the focus of videogame production and consumption. It puts the study in the context of Jenkins\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} call for a \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}popular aesthetics\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}.

The first chapter gives the theoretical underpinnings of the thesis\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s critical approach to videogames. The thesis compares games to other media as a result of criticisms of medium specificity in philosophical aesthetics and considerations of media convergence. It offers Manovich\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s concepts of information design and information behaviour as the basis of a comparative approach. The thesis generalises from particular experiences of play, and it draws on prior critical practice in justifying this approach. The thesis analyses audiovisual aspects of videogame play, and it synthesises a model of gamic mise-en-scene for this purpose. 

The second chapter looks at the parallel origins of media art and early videogames in the context of videogame archaeology. It locates the emergence of artworks by Nam June Paik and the earliest videogames in relation to changing discourses and definitions of artistic practice and the technological utopianism of 1960s culture. It considers the quick adoption of home game technologies and the early success of arcade play which arise from prominent approaches to media history. 

The third chapter approaches narrative and fiction in videogames. It tracks the history of narrative and fiction as concepts in videogame studies, pays extended attention to Juul\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s concept of fictional worlds, and develops this in the light of Jenkins\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and Manovich\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}architectural\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} approaches to videogames. It shows, through close textual analyses of two early games, that rather than being epiphenomena of rule structures, players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} imperatives are embedded and revealed as aspects of fictional worlds constructed through audiovisual design. 

The fourth chapter stages an encounter between the space shooter and emerging conversations around genre in videogame studies. It shows that genre is a multidimensional phenomenon, and that videogames genres can be understood in relation to a broader cultural context. Specifically arguing that the space shooter is a brand of science fiction, it shows that these games refract the genre in a new way, and can be seen as a reflection on the emergence of videogames as an \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}uncanny\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} technology of real-time interaction.

Can this also be applied to a DARWARS (Training Superiority) online training community? For example, will these communities be scale-free with \&quot;hub\&quot; users who disproportionately influence the training focus? How will these networks grow? We do not know, yet. But we do know that from the ongoing experiment of the online game world will come ideas and insights that will enable us to design and measure a DARWARS community. DARWARS is a DARPA-funded effort to revolutionize training and increase military readiness by providing online practice combining a robust technical infrastructure with elements from computer-aided instruction, intelligent tutoring systems, and multiplayer games. The vision of DARWARS is to <strong>bring together trainees, trainers, subject matter experts across military echelons, geographic locations, as well as use-cases (training events, single participant after-hours, etc.) into an active community with different reinforcing interests: pedagogy, training, entertainment, and content creation</strong>. A challenge of DARWARS is to develop mutually supporting communities. To forward our understanding of community, <strong>this paper will examine aspects of the online game world with which we expect our DARWARS community to share important properties.</strong> This paper will cite a number of illustrating lessons, related to community. In particular we will examine the content-creation role of community.

The externality causes certain peripheral sellers to charge prices that are unprofitably high. That is, these firms could earn greater profits if only they could coordinate to charge lower prices. In many markets, such coordination is possible; firms can contract, for example, or integrate. In markets based on relatively new platform technologies, however, coordination will typically be difficult.

The energy consumption during VG (max 1.71 kcal/min) was unaltered compared to RS and significantly lower compared to ET even at the starting strain of 25 W (1.94 kcal/min). Hemodynamic parameters tested demonstrated lower HR, unchanged SBP, and higher DBP during the VG compared with ET.

The results of the evaluation show that educational virtual reality games can be very motivating while retaining or even improving the educational effects on students.

@phdthesis{Samuel2004,
abstract = {This dissertation looks at the phenomenon of hacktivism: the marriage of political activism and computer hacking. It defines hacktivism as the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of political ends. These tools include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft, web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, virtual sabotage, and software development. The dissertation uses data from fifty-one interviews in conjunction with additional primary and secondary source material. This data is used to construct a taxonomy of hacktivism, and to apply the taxonomy to three core issues in political participation. Chapter 2 presents a taxonomy of hacktivism defined by variation in hacktivist origins (in the hacker-programmer or artist-activist worlds) and orientations (transgressive or outlaw). The dissertation identifies three distinct types of hacktivism: political cracking, which consists of illegal actions like web site defacements and redirects; performative hacktivism, which consists of legally nebulous actions like virtual sit-ins and web site parodies; and political coding, which consists of political software development. The taxonomy illuminates several key questions in political participation, each examined in a different chapter. Chapter 3 focuses on the role of identity incentives in shaping political participation, and finds a strong correlation between hacktivist origins and the type of hacktivism engaged in. Chapter 4 looks at political coders’ strategy of policy circumvention, which focuses on nullifying rather than changing a targeted law or policy. The success of this strategy depends on political entrepreneurs, low costs of failure, and high political costs of repression. Chapter 5 examines deliberative democrats’ suggestion that the Internet may constitute a new public sphere, friendly to democratic discourse. It suggests that variation in how hacktivists handle speech rights and anonymity challenges proceduralist visions of deliberative democracy. After reflecting on the themes that unite the dissertation, the conclusion reflects on how the post 9/11 political climate has heightened the pressure to erroneously treat hacktivism as cyberterrorism. The author hopes that the rising fortunes of political coding, which is increasingly legitimated by both governments and businesses, will ensure a continued space for hacktivism within the repertoire of political contention.},

@phdthesis{4449,
abstract = {This dissertation concerns the functionality of sound in computer games, with focus on the relationship between game audio, player actions and events in the game. The central questions of investigation in the project centre on how game sound affects player actions, and how auditory information enables the player to take action in the game world. On this basis, the focus lies on the relationship between the use of audio and the player, with emphasis on the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s actions and responses.

The point of departure is that the functionality of game audio depends on the dual nature of computer games as a game world and a user system. As a game world, the computer game is seen as a coherent virtual environment in which the player acts and which utilizes sound to enhance the sense of presence in this game world. As a user system, the computer game is manipulated by the player through an interface consisting of input devices such as game controller or mouse/keyboard and audiovisual output. This user system emphasises sound as a usability feature that provides reactive and proactive information to the player. Computer game audio combines these roles by making usability sounds merge into sounds that seem to be motivated by a sense or presence and the illusion of realism in the game world.

The project draws on theory primarily from two different angles. The first is film theory on sound and music, which studies the use of sound in an audiovisual context where it seeks to emphasise a specific fictive world. The division between diegetic sound that appears to belong naturally to the game universe and extradiegtic sound that seems to comment on what happens within the game world from an external perspective has been central in understanding how audio works to support the virtual game world. The second theoretical angle is auditory display studies, which derives from ecological psychoacoustics and human-computer interface studies. Auditory display studies research and develop systems that utilize sound for communicative purposes in computer systems, virtual simulators and the everyday life. The ideas of how different types of sound signals may be used to provide different kinds of responsive and urgent information have been fruitful in understanding how game audio works for usability purposes. 

The study is also based on empirical studies of computer game players and game audio developers. Game developer interviews have revealed purposes and intentions behind audio in computer games, and pointed out possibilities and constraints in connection with game audio development, while the interviews with and observations of players of two different games have demonstrated how actual players understand and utilize sound in the gaming context.

Implementing technology can benefit their lives and improve social interaction. This study develops the embodied interactive video games (EIVG) relying on embodied interactions, which are free from the fine motor skills like pointing, grasping etc. Four research objectives include (1) To evaluate the usability of the EIVG; (2) To evaluate the dependability of the EIVG; (3) To understand the flow experiences of the elders during game play; (4) To explore the relations between the usability, dependability, and the elders\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} flow experiences. The results were discussed in three aspects. In terms of the usability and dependability of the game system, the elders were satisfied with the EIVG games due to the familiarity of the content and the ease of interaction. In terms of the flow experiences, the challenge of the games played an important role to the elders with high SES. In terms of the relations between usability, dependability, and flow experience, the usability and dependability were identified as critical factors for the elders to use computer technology due to the cognitive ageing.},

Study 1 focused on the differential motivations between the addicts and nonaddicts. The findings revealed that the addicts exhibited higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation, whereas the nonaddicts showed an opposite relationship. The intrinsic motivation of the addicts was also higher than the nonaddicts. The results imply that intrinsic motivation plays a crucial role in gaming addiction. Study 2 was conducted to examine whether four factors that moderate the detrimental effect of extrinsic motivators on intrinsic motivation would function as predicted. Results indicated that extrinsic rewards would undermine intrinsic motivation when they were high expectancy, high relevance, tangible, and noncontingent. Thus, players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} intrinsic motivation would be higher when extrinsic rewards were low expectancy, low relevance, intangible, and contingent.

An immensely popular form of entertainment among children and teens, advergames integrate advertising and market research strategies directly into the fabric of online games and environments. I begin by situating advergames within broader traditions of advertising to children. I then present and discuss four potential \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}points of entry\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} for the regulation of these new media advertising practices, which include media regulation, consumer protection law, industry self regulation and contract law. As media regulation in Canada and the US share many similarities, and because children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s digital media is most often transnational with a large proportion of content originating from the US, the discussion draws upon both Canadian and US legislation, providing comparisons where relevant.

abstract = {Since the first computer games became available, sex has played a role in some form. But with the release of games like Playboy: The Mansion, Leisure Suit Larry, and The Singles, sexual content has gained a firm foothold and for the first time, ventured into the mainstream. Even casual games like The Sims have started to rev things up a bit, and in on-line games, tales of \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}cybering\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} have become commonplace. This \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}sexual revolution\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} in games has generated intense scrutiny of the games industry by political watchdog groups and family-oriented organizations.

And it has brought the importance of self-regulation and rating systems to the forefront of the industry. Seeking to understand this emerging trend, developers, publishers, retailers, and consumers are asking themselves: When is sex appropriate in a game? How far is too far? What will it mean for the product? For its distribution? For my company? For me? Do games with sexual content sell better? Are they generally profitable? So far, there are no definitive answers to these questions. Sex in Video Games provides insight into this issue and presents guidelines and answers by studying the history of sexual content use in games and within the industry itself. In addition, the book considers ethical issues, parental and retailer responsibility, and explores industry attempts at self-regulation, along with a growing concern about potential censorship.

abstract = {In interactive computer games and computer animation, intuitively controlling the motion of an articulated character is considered as a difficult task. One of the reasons is that, typically, an articulated model used in the field has a high degree-of-freedom (DOF) for joints so that it is challenging to devise an easy-to-use interface to control the individual DOR In this paper, as an alternative to existing techniques for controlling articulated characters, we propose the traditional marionette control [I] as natural interfaces to control the characters, and explain how to implement a virtual marionette based on physically-based modelling and haptic paradigm. Using our virtual marionette system, we can rapidly but easily create sophisticated motions for a high-DOF articulated character. Moreover, our system relies on haptic interfaces to model the behavior of real-world marionette controls and provides to the puppeteer responsive forces as a result of the created motions. This results in the puppeteer having a better sense of control over the marionette that she or he manipulates. Our experimentations show that our system can create reasonably complicated motions for articulated characters in an easy and quick manner at highly interactive rates.},

A cross-sectional study was performed on the entire adolescent population (n=833) of a private situated in the city of Sao Paulo. The research included a questionnaire and physical examination of the musculoskeletal system. Statistical analysis was carried out with Fisher, chi-square, Mann Whitney tests and logistic regression. A total of 791 adolescent was evaluated. A computer was used by 99\% and video games by 58\%. Pain was reported by 312 (39.4\%) students: 23\% complained of back pain, 9\% of upper limb pain, 4\% of diffuse pain and 4\% of pain in the trapezium muscle. A clinical examination was carried out in 359 students, and one or more musculoskeletal pain syndromes were present in 56 students (15.6\%): benign joint hypermobility syndrome in 10\%, myofascial syndrome in 5\%, tendonitis in 2\% and fibromyalgia in 1\%. In the multivariate analysis, the logistical regression showed that the independent variables in the prediction of pain were sex [odds ratio (OR): 2.19, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 1.33-3.61] and age (OR: 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.28) and that the prediction of musculoskeletal pain syndromes were sex (OR: 3.17, 95\% CI: 1.69-6.22) and number of days a week using the computer (OR: 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.05-1.42). However, the variations in the dependent variables by the mathematical regression models were low. Despite the frequent use of computer and video games among adolescents, this was not associated with the presence of pain and musculoskeletal pain syndromes.},

In response to this, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) drafted a set of technology standards for teachers (ISTE, 2002) that specifically states that teachers should empower all students and support diversity. This content analysis of educational software for preschoolers was designed to look at gender representations and stereotyping. The results demonstrated significantly more male characters than female characters in preschool educational software, which makes it difficult for teachers to address gender diversity and suggests that girls are not as valued as boys are. Male characters were also more likely than female characters to exhibit several masculine-stereotypical traits. In addition, female characters more than male characters exhibited counterstereotypical behaviors, yet were more gender stereotyped in appearance.},

That is, people\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s self-perceptions are likely to shape their discourse behavior, but their (and their partners\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}) discourse behavior in turn will shape their subsequent self-perceptions. To provide empirical evidence for this proposal, we conducted a study in which pairs of friends (n = 21 pairs) encountered a computer game. One friend played the game while the other observed; subsequently, both were asked to jointly tell a third party about their experience with the game. The resulting conversations were coded for narrative and other contributions, and discourse elements were examined in relation to pre- and postparticipation perceptions of expertise at the game. Players produced more narrative contributions than observers but only when observers had low self-perceived expertise prior to the game. Observers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} narrative contributions were linked to changes in the players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} self-perceptions of game expertise from prior to postconversation. These findings show that self-perceptions of expertise both shape, and are shaped by, discourse behavior.},

This change is occurring at a time when the line separating game and physical worlds is becoming less distinct. The new business model entails a subtle but significant reduction in consumer rights awareness, which explains why some members of the greater gaming community are negotiating a new sense of fairness and arriving at a new consensus regarding legitimate gameplay.},

Setting: Data were collected at community agencies or during home visits. Participants: Low-income, European American and African American mothers (N = 155). Intervention: Participants were exposed to nutrition education material in 1 of 3 modalities (a computer game, The Fantastic Food Challenge; Web site; or pamphlet). Likeability, nutrition knowledge, intention to use, and demographic measures followed the intervention at T1 and T2. Main Outcome Measures: 5-point Likert-type scales measured likeability (5 items), and 33 multiple-choice questions measured knowledge. Analysis: Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) procedures using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software, P < .05. Results: Overall, the Web site was liked more than the other conditions with this audience of women. Significant differences in attention, understanding, and intent to use the information existed across modalities. The Web site performed better than other modalities on knowledge outcomes, with no differences in knowledge retention from T1 toT2. Conclusions and Implications: The Web site modality performed best with this audience of women, indicating that interactive computer games may not confer greater benefits than traditional modes of information delivery for all audiences, particularly those with low computer skills. $\backslash$copyright2008 SOCIETY FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION.},

But what is it that has driven video games? development? Is it technology? Indeed, with every new generation of hardware, game designers were given a broader set of tools for evoking exhilarating experiences. But is not culture at least as important? What would games look like if Tolkien never had written Lord of the Rings, or if Nintendo had not brought Japanese manga drawing styles to the new medium?

environments, dPVS, can benefit such applications as CAD and modeling

optimization is currently the most effective technique for improving
rendering performance in complex 3D environments. The primary reason
for this is that during each frame the pixel processing subsystem needs
to determine the visibility of each pixel individually. Currently,
rendering performance in larger scenes is input sensitive, and most of
the processing time is wasted on rendering geometry not visible in the
final image. Here we concentrate on real-time visualization using
mainstream graphics hardware that has a z-buffer as a de facto standard
for hidden surface removal. In an ideal system only the complexity of
the geometry actually visible on the screen would significantly impact
rendering time - 3D application performance should be output sensitive.

Consistent with the findings of previous studies, female characters were found to be underrepresented and proportionally more often sexualized in comparison to their male counterparts. In addition to these findings, the study's innovative method-the use of online video game reviews as an indirect measure of video game content-shows promise as a tool for future content analyses of video games.},

Between AIED and video games there is an emerging enterprise, that is, virtual characters in video learning game design. This paper proposes a Profile-Driven-Interaction (PDI) framework which borrows the design experience of virtual characters from AIED research to that for video learning games. The PDI framework enables virtual characters to take roles for various educational purposes based on the learner model of that learner and learner models of other learners. These virtual characters are designed in such a way that when they interact with a learner, the learner is actually improving her learning status. Based on this framework, a video learning game, called My-Pet-and-Her-Friends, is developed to address some relevant issues in the learning process, in particular, the issues of engagement and reflection of the learner.

abstract = {Some researchers have suggested that designing and implementing games
can lead to deeper forms of learning than simply playing games created
by others. Learner design efforts may benefit from the increasing
number of computational engines that allow users to customize and
expand game behaviors. We seek to understand how modifying, or modding,
existing games can lead to various forms of learning.
Game design can be a powerful motivator for learning complex skills.
For instance, studies of elementary school children who designed
educational games suggested that programming could be a medium for
personal and creative expression as well as helping learners develop
informal notions of mathematical and computational formalisms (Harel,
1991; Kafai, 1994). Learning by designing provides opportunities to
engage in rich problem solving activities that resemble those of expert
game designers.
Unfortunately, designing and implementing games is a daunting task.
Building games with high-level computer languages requires a great deal
of work unrelated to game play, and simpler authoring tools often fail
to provide the realism that learners see in modern video games.
Fortunately, designers began abstracting their games from the
underlying engines that handle graphical rendering, camera control,
lighting and so. These engines allow games to be modified, and
communities of players now routinely alter and share modded games with
others. Modding also involves some degree of learning, but the overhead
of tweaking these game engines is significantly less than other
options, especially if the goal is to produce products that resemble
current, commercial games. More so, we believe that modding can lead to
opportunities to learn by designing.
Presentation
Our session will describe the types of learning that can occur while
modding games, e.g., computer programming, mathematics, physics,
artificial intelligence, and software engineering. We will present
these ideas through case studies of high school and college students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}
modding in classroom settings and qualitative analyses of what they
learned by creating working demonstrations of video games. We will
focus on the curricular activities designed to ease the complexity of
modding game engines and discuss difficulties that emerged during the
courses. Student comments on the degree of effort required to work with
different game engines will also be presented, as those have helped us
to understand how to design modding exercises that promote learning of
various domain skills. In the end, we hope to promote a new direction
for research, in particular promote the research in the design and
development of tools that can emphasize learning by modding.

This is somewhat surprising given that the manual scan of journals and copying of selected articles in the university library have transformed into an online discovery in various full-text and bibliographic databases. What is more, there are several insightful text mining and information visualization tools that have been developed to help the researcher in profiling, mapping and visualizing knowledge domains. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate by way of an example the potential of a new approach called research profiling, and to raise discussion about the method\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s applicability in enriching traditional literature reviews. The specific topic of interest in this paper is digital games research as indexed in the ISI Web of Science. Altogether 2.136 articles were profiled. Almost half of the digital games research were classified either under computer science or psychology, or their subcategories. Only a small subset of the research was conducted from a business or management school perspective, which points to an obvious gap in the literature.

Activities during play were recorded and these data are analysed in terms of social networks. It was found that while the playing-cards led to attempts to apply the same type of activity in both seated and mobile conditions, the use of PDA led to differences in play. These differences were due to both technical, i.e., availability of players in the Bluetooth network, and social, i.e., visibility of players in the world and the activity of the Dealer.

While computer game playing has important social effects for children, how children accomplish their social activity during computer use is very much taken for granted in the game-playing literature. This article addresses young children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s computer game playing through a detailed analysis of two children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s interaction while playing a Wiggles game in their home. Conversation analysis is employed to describe and explicate the social accomplishment of playing the game through a sequential analysis of data. Discussion considers the local organization of the game, its occasioned complexity, and the management of identity-related activities during game playing. The study provides a description of the ways that social interaction accomplishes the children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s game playing.},

Online consumers may also browse endlessly through virtual marketplaces and create and display virtual goods. These virtual commodities are desired and enjoyed as if they were real, but are not actually bought, or owned in a material sense \{$\backslash$textendash\} often resulting in frustration amongst marketers. In this paper we account for virtualised consumption by highlighting its pleasures. We start by historicising the trend towards imaginary consumption practices, depicting virtual consumption as the latest stage in an ongoing transformation of consumption from a focus on utility through to emotional value, sign value and finally playful experience. Viewed from this perspective, we consider the role of emerging virtual consumption spaces as liminoid, transformational play-spaces and explore examples of consumer practices found in these spaces. Ultimately we argue that virtual spaces encourage the development of new consumption practices and therefore constitute the ability of the market to stimulate consumers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} imaginations in new and exciting ways based on digital play.},

abstract = {This paper describes ePet, a novel multi-player physical game based on the WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). ePet shifts the traditional virtual pet games to the real world, featuring with the popular RPG (Role-Playing Game) elements. The game, capitalizing on the wireless communication, mobile computing, and sensing ability, can be played both indoors and outdoors, and thus gives players a new exciting gaming experience that profits by the blend of real and virtual game elements. The physical game acquires physical interactions among players, which can bring exciting and novel features to the game and more importantly, avoids some problems caused by traditional computer games such as health problems. The WSN is a promising technology for developing physical games. Although there is already some research and applications of WSN based physical games, the major advantages of the WSN (e.g. wireless communication, mobile computing, and sensing ability) are not fully cultivated in these gaming applications. ePet, which takes good advantages of both the WSN and traditional computer games, simulates a pet both indoors and outdoors. The pet has two life modes: Peaceful Life Mode (PLM) and Aggressive Life Mode (ALM). In the PLM, ePet simulates the physiological activities of a real pet such as hunger and easily getting flu when it is cold in the real world. Moreover, the pet can date with other pets to increase its physiological values. In the ALM, the pet is a character of an RPG controlled by the player and the pet can have a fight with other pets, from which the pet gains experience for level up. This ALM is similar to the computer RPG games but relatively novel in WSN based games. All of the above features are enabled by the WSN technology. For the two life modes, a friend-making protocol and an RPG battle protocol are designed respectively. The architecture design and implementation of ePet are described in detailed. Unlike traditional WSN based games, ePet does not need a centralized base station to organize the network. To implement a self-adaptive wireless sensor network in which each node has a similar functionality, and solve the network conflict problems in the WSN communications, a multi-hop communication routing protocol is designed for ePet. Furthermore, a PC application was developed as the game interface, from which players can check out the ePet\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s properties and interact with ePet. It makes ePet more attractive than traditional WSN based games without losing WSN\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s advantages.},

abstract = {This study found significant relationships between first- and second-order cultivation measures and TV viewing, but found a relationship with video game play for only two variables in a sample of 322 Flemish 3rd and 6th year secondary school children. This suggests that the absence of a relationship with video game play is not the result of the absence of cultivation effects in Flanders. On the other hand it shows that the relationship between TV viewing and cultivation measures is not an artifact of systematic over reporting. The study concludes that cultivation measures typical of the "television world" are not related to playing video games. To study video game cultivation measures must be sought which reflect the mainstream of (particular genres of) video games. The role of selectivity needs to be studied more closely. As gainers play an active role in the violence of the games the possibility that self-protecting strategies are employed in processing video game contents must be taken into consideration. Existing process theories explaining what happens in television cultivation may be challenged by research into the cultivation effects of video games.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in utilising intelligent agents in computer games and virtual environments. At the same time, computer game research and development has increasingly drawn on technologies and techniques originally developed in the large scale distributed simulation community, such as the HLA IEEE standard for simulator interoperability. In this paper, we address a central issue for HLA-based games, namely the development of HLA-compliant game agents. We present HLA \_ AGENT, an HLA-compliant version of the SIM\_AGENT toolkit for building cognitively rich agents. We outline the changes necessary to the SIM \_ AGENT toolkit to allow integration with the HLA, and show that, given certain reasonable assumptions, all necessary code can be generated automatically from the FOM and the object class publications and subscriptions. The integration is transparent in the sense that the existing SIM\_AGENT code runs unmodified and the agents are unaware that other parts of the system are running remotely. We present some preliminary performance results, which indicate that the overhead introduced by the HLA extension is modest even for lightweight agents with limited computational requirements. },

abstract = {Background: Video game seizures have been reported in photosensitive and non-photosensitive patients with epilepsy. The game Super Mario World, has led to many cases of first seizures. We examined whether this game was indeed more provocative than other programs and whether playing the game added to this effect. Methods: We prospectively investigated 352 patients in four European cities, using a standard protocol including testing of a variety of visual stimuli. We correlated historical data on provocative factors in daily life with electroencephalographic laboratory findings. Results: The video game, Super Mario World proved more epileptogenic than standard TV programs and as provocative as programs with flashing lights and patterns. Most striking was the fact that video game- viewing and-playing on the 50 and 100 Hz TV was significantly more provocative than viewing the standard program (P < 0.001, P < 0.05 respectively). Playing the video game Mario World on a 50 Hz TV, appeared to be significantly more provocative than playing this game on the 100 Hz TV (P < 0.001). Of 163 patients with a history of TV-, VG- or CG-seizures, 85\% of them showed epileptiform discharges in response to photic stimulation, 44\% to patterns, 59\% to 50 Hz TV and 29\% to 100 Hz TV. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with a history of video game seizures are, in the vast majority, photosensitive and should be investigated with standardised photic stimulation. Games and programs with bright background or flashing images are specifically provocative. Playing a video game on a 100 Hz TV is less provocative .},

abstract = {Since Lara first “bust” onto our screens in 1996 in Tomb Raider (Edios Interactive), she has been a focal point for critical debate surrounding the representation of the female protagonist and the gendered body in games. Nearly twenty years after her first appearance, the 2013 version of Tomb Raider (Crystal Dynamics) remakes Lara with a new body, a new author, and has sent her out towards a new generation of fans. In line with attempts by the games industry to provide a more appealing female protagonist, Lara has been significantly altered physically and in terms of her attitude, but what is perhaps most striking is the way that her narrative has also been redefined by a female writer, and then taken even further by a more gender-savvy fanbase willing to give Lara a second chance. This paper examines the 2013 iteration of Tomb Raider in the light of previous scholarship, arguing that despite, as Kirkland argues “The meaning of the controllable figure ‘Lara Croft’ within the Tomb Raider series is inseparable from the paratexts that surround it” (Kirkland, 2014), that critics have often used Lara’s sexualised appearance to unfairly dismiss the players who see her as an icon or those that have simply enjoyed playing with and through her for nearly 20 years. Critically, her body and her gender have been seen as indistinguishable, and this is used in turn to disenfranchise the experience of the player who controls her. I will also consider how new ways of consuming games -- most notably through webcasting playthroughs -- are working to change the ways in which gender is formulated in digital games. Here, games are reframed by the fan producers who overlay narratives on top of the existing text, reinterpreting it in ways that provide interesting new readings of how Lara is understood by her own players.},

A tessellation process is often used to convert a deformable object into polygons so that the hardware graphics accelerator may render them. Unfortunately, this tessellation process is computationally very expensive. While the object is deforming, the tessellation process needs to be performed repeatedly to convert the deforming objects into polygons. As a result, deforrnable objects are seldom used in real-time applications such as virtual environments and computer games. Since trimmed NURBS surfaces are often used to represent deformable objects, in this paper we present an efficient method for incremental rendering of deformable trimmed NURBS surfaces. A trimmed NURBS surface typically deforms through the deformation of the trimmed NURBS surface and/or the trimming curve. Our method handles both trimmed surface deformation as well as trimming curve deformation. Experimental results show that our method performs significantly faster than the method used in OpenGL and can be used in real-time applications, such as computer games.},

abstract = {The extremely high level of simulated violence in certain recent video games has made some people uneasy. There is a concern that something is wrong with these violent games, but, since the violence is virtual rather than real, it is difficult to specify the nature of the wrongness. Since there is no proven causal connection between video-game violence and real violence, philosophical analysis can be particularly helpful in locating potential sources of wrongness in ultra-violent video games. To this end, this paper analyzes video game violence through the lens of utilitarian, Kantian, and post-modern perspectives. Through these analyses, several explanations of the wrongness in violent video games emerge.

While teaching a course on optimizing online communication behaviour and social network analysis, we collected preliminary data on the relationship between dynamic social network structures and individual and team performance. Students from Helsinki University of Technology and University of Cologne, who had never met face to face, formed virtual interdisciplinary teams collaborating on a common task, the communication analysis of online communities. As part of their task, students correlated performance of the community they were analysing with social network structure. In this research, we compare social network structure and individual and team performance of participants in a multi-user online computer game with social network structure and performance among the student teams. While among computer gamers the number of communication links predicts performance, a balanced contribution index predicts performance of the student knowledge worker teams. We also give general recommendations for efficient virtual communication behaviour.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of physical activity, television program viewing and other forms of video viewing with the prevalence of obesity among school children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: 712 children, 9-16 y old, from a low- and a middle-income town in the Mexico City area. MEASUREMENTS: Children completed a self administered questionnaire to assess time spent in physical activity and television viewing, and diet. Height weight and triceps skinfolds were measured. The outcome variable was obesity, and the covariates were hours of television programs and other video viewing, physical activity, energy intake, percentage of energy from fat, town of location of school, age, gender and perception of mother\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s weight status. RESULTS: Among 461 children with complete information, 24\% were classified as obese. Children reported an average of 4.1 +/- 2.2 h/d watching television (2.4 +/- 1.5 h/d for TV programs and 1.7 +/- 1.5 h/d for video cassette recorder (VCR) or videogames), and 1.8 +/- 1.3 h/d in moderate and vigorous physical activities. Odds ratios (OR) of obesity were 12\% higher for each hour of television program viewing per day (OR = 1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.02,-1.22), and 10\% lower for each hour of moderate/vigorous physical activity per day (OR = 0.90, 95\% CI 0.83 - 0:98), controlling for age, gender, town and perception of mother\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s weight status. Children in the middle-income town had higher adjusted odds of obesity (OR = 2.58, 95\% CI 1.47 - 4.54). CONCLUSION: Physical activity and television viewing, but not VCR/videogames use, were related to obesity prevalence in Mexican children 9-16 y old.},

As complex 3d interactions are required to compose 3d objects, sophisticated 3d visualization- and interaction techniques are included. Among these techniques are shadow generation, 3d input devices, snapping mechanisms and collision detection. The puzzle, similar to a computer game, can be operated at different levels. To simplify the task, a subset of the geometry, e.g. the skeleton, can be correctly assembled initially. Moreover, textual information concerning the region of objects is provided, along with snapping mechanisms to support the user. With this approach we expect. to motivate students to explore the spatial relations between parts of the human body.},

Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability.

In this article, we address the role of humor in computer games, especially in support of serious purposes. We begin with a review of the main theories of humor, including superiority, incongruity, and relief. These theories and their interrelationships do well in helping us understand the humor process, but they have been developed in the context of traditional human activity. To explore how they relate to computer games, we present the findings of a qualitative study of player experience of humor and show how it relates to the theoretical perspectives. We then review the main functions of humor, especially its effects on social, emotional, and cognitive behavior. We show how each of these functions can be used in game design to support the specific experiences and outcomes of game-play. Finally, we address the issue of serious games and make suggestions on how humor can inform and support the design of those games. We suggest that humor can support design by smoothing and sustaining the game mechanics. Moreover, games can draw on the functions of humor in the real world for enhancing communication, learning, and social presence. Using humor makes games richer and more powerful, as well as fun.},

The concept of artificial life has broadened its reach from a rarefied speculative discipline to a phenomenon in popular culture and a fertile trope within the electronic arts.

Questions to do with artificial life range from the representation or incarnation of our \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}real\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} selves as avatars in digital spaces (such as computer games), to popular, artistic and scientific attempts to simulate autonomous life forms. In the context of digital art, the essay critically engages with the work of Australian artist Troy Innocent, in particular with his most recent installation, Artefact (2001). In Artefact, Innocent actively investigates the digital investment of life in avatars as they operate in an interactive game environment. In this work, Innocent prompts an intriguing, if troubling, question, central to the overall interests of this essay: what, in the age of digital simulation is not alive?},

general, mostly focuses on character and plot development.
It is important to investigate the change of plot and
character responses due to interaction in interactive stories.
However, it is also important to investigate the change of
visual designs and setups, including lighting color, position
and angle, camera angle, position, and movement, and
characters\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} movements and gestures, and their functions in
interactive stories. While the importance of visual design is
unquestionable in film and theatre, only a few research
attempts have been made to devise a system that changes
visual designs and setups depending on story interaction.
The paper describes an approach to build story visualization
systems that dynamically change visual designs/setups to
suit plot and authorial intention, and to emotionally engage
the participant in a dramatic experience.},

abstract = {In recent years, large scale distributed virtual environments have become a major trend in distributed applications, mainly due to the enormous popularity of multiplayer online games in the entertainment industry. Thus, scalability has become an essential issue for these highly interactive systems. In this paper, we propose a new synchronization technique for those distributed virtual environments that are based on networked-server architectures. Unlike other methods described in the literature, the proposed technique takes into account the updating messages exchanged by avatars, thus releasing the servers from updating the location of such avatars when synchronizing the state of the system. As a result, the communications required for synchronization are greatly reduced, and this method results more scalable. Also, these communications are distributed along the whole synchronization period, in order to reduce workload peaks. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the percentage of CPU utilization in the servers when compared with other existing methods, therefore supporting a higher number of avatars. Additionally, the system response time is reduced accordingly.},

abstract = {Present computer games and digital entertainment do not usually facilitate intergenerational family interactions. According to recent survey results in Japan, there is a high percentage of older people who own and play electronic or computer games, but rarely do they play the games with their family members. it is a positive sign that more older people are participating in the digital games arena, but it would be even more beneficial if they Could interact actively with the young family members through gaming activities. This could possibly strengthen family bonding and bridge the gap between older people and youth culture.This paper presents steps for designing an intergenerational family entertainment system which focuses Oil physical and social interactions using a mixed reality floor system. The main design goals include: facilitating interactions between users with varied levels of skill in utilizing technology, utilizing the familiar physical motions from other activities to make an intuitive physical interface, and encouraging social interactions among families and friends. Detailed implementation of these steps is presented in the design of our intergenerational entertainment system, Age Invaders. Four main prototype iterations for the system is presented. Our design process is based on User Centered Design and relies on constant involvement of users to understand the key issues and to help make effective design decisions. The results of the study help to focus the refinements of the existing platform from a usability standpoint and also aids in the development of new physical entertainment and interactive applications. This study provides insights into user issues including how users interact in a complex mixed reality experience, which is heavily based in physicality. The use of one portion of the user base which is most proficient with technology before involving the novice users was found to empower novice users to begin to use digital technology.

abstract = {Objective: Environmental factors and behaviors associated with obesity have not been well described in children living in Europe. Although television watching has been repeatedly associated with obesity, it is unclear whether other sedentary activities, such as use of electronic games, are independently associated with obesity in children. The hypothesis was that various types of sedentary activities are associated with obesity in children living in Switzerland. Research Methods and Procedures: This was a cross-sectional study of children (grades one to three) from four communities in the Greater Zurich Area (Switzerland). Obesity was defined as a combination of overweight (BMI) and overfat (skinfold thicknesses). Environmental factors were assessed by questionnaire. The children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physical activity was estimated by their teacher (scale 0 to 10). Results: Of 922 eligible subjects, 872 (94.6\%) took part in the study. Use of electronic games [odds ratio (OR) = 2.03 per hour per day, 95\% confidence interval (Cl): 1.57 to 2.61, p < 0.001], television (OR = 2.83 per hour per day, 95\% CI: 2.08 to 3.86, p < 0.001), physical activity (OR = 0.80 per unit, 95\% CI: 0.72 to 0.88, p < 0.001), maternal work (OR = 1.93, 95\% Cl: 1.13 to 3.29, p = 0.02), and paternal smoking (OR = 1.78, 95\% CI: 1.07 to 2.96, p = 0.03) were independently associated with obesity. Further adjustment for socioeconomic status, when available, did not change these results. Discussion: In this sample of children living in Switzerland, the use of electronic games was significantly associated with obesity, independently of confounding factors. The association of obesity with television use and lack of physical activity confirms results from other populations and points to potential strategies for obesity prevention.},

@article{Barsalou1999,
abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

One advancement in computer games are interactive games that use physical activity as a game playing controller, combining exercise and entertainment, or exertainment. Purpose: This study tested the reinforcing value and activity levels of interactive dance and bicycle race games in 18 overweight and 17 non-overweight 8- to 12-year-old youth. Methods: Reinforcing value was studied using a behavioral choice paradigm that provided children the opportunity to respond on progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement for a choice of either playing the video dance or bicycle game using a handheld video game controller or one of three options: dancing or bicycling alone, dancing or bicycling while watching a video, or playing the interactive dance or bicycle game. Reinforcing value was defined in relationship to the amount of responding children engaged in for either choice. Results: Results showed the interactive dance game was more reinforcing than dancing alone or dancing while watching the video (p = .003), but there was no difference across bicycling conditions. Nonoverweight youth were more active when given the opportunity to play the interactive dance game than overweight children (p = .05). Conclusions: These results suggest that children may be motivated to be active when given the opportunity to play an interactive dance game.},

However, game flow and structure were largely unrelated to each other with one exception.

abstract = {The decision-making process of computer-controlled opponents in video games is called game AI. Adaptive game AI can improve the entertainment value of games by allowing computer-controlled opponents to fix weaknesses automatically in the game AI and to respond to changes in human-player tactics. Dynamic scripting is a reinforcement learning approach to adaptive game AI that learns, during gameplay, which game tactics an opponent should select to play effectively. In previous work, the tactics used by dynamic scripting were designed manually. We introduce the evolutionary state-based tactics generator (ESTG), which uses an evolutionary algorithm to generate tactics automatically. Experimental results show that ESTG improves dynamic scripting\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s performance in a realtime strategy game. We conclude that high-quality domain knowledge can be automatically generated for strong adaptive game AI opponents. Game developers can benefit from applying ESTG, as it considerably reduces the time and effort needed to create adaptive game AI.},

We propose that Al for interactive computer games is an emerging application area in which this goal of human-level Al can successfully be pursued. Interactive computer games have increasingly complex and realistic worlds and increasingly complex and intelligent computer-controlled characters. In this article, we further motivate our proposal of using interactive computer games for Al research, review previous research on Al and games, and present the different game genres and the roles that human-level Al could play within these genres. We then describe the research issues and Al techniques that are relevant to each of these roles. Our conclusion is that interactive computer games provide a rich environment for incremental research on human-level AI.},

Results indicated often significant but quite modest correlations between children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s self-reports of their emotional behaviour and their behaviours as coded during the play session. For the magnitude of these correlations, there were not significant developmental differences, and the strength of the correlations did not differ for same- or for other-gender dyads.

While building computer games has typically been a commercial endeavor, we believe that designing and constructing a computer game is also a useful activity for educating students about geometric modeling and computer graphics. In particular, students are exposed to the practical issues surrounding topics such as geometric modeling, rendering. collision detection, character animation and graphical design. Moreover, building an advanced game provides students exposure to the real-world side of software engineering that they are typically shielded from in the standard computer class. In this paper, we describe our experiences with teaching a computer science class that focuses on designing and building the best game possible in the course of a semester. The paper breaks down a typical game into various components that are suited for individual student projects and discusses the use of modem graphical design tools such as Maya in building art for the game. We conclude with a rough timeline for developing a game during the course of a semester and review some of the lessons learned during the three years we have taught the class.},

There might exist developmental benefits or positive effects of computer games that can be used for educational or therapeutic purposes. More important several studies have well demonstrated that excessive computer game playing is associated with behavior that features all components of non-chemical addiction and the prevalences across all age groups seem to be impressingly high. Objective: This overview relies on a Medline research. Its objective is to describe motivational and developmental characteristics attributed to computer games as well as the prevalences of computer playing in children and adolescents to better understand the risks for addictive use. We especially focus on the relations of excessive computer playing with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior. Results: The results demonstrate that children with ADHD are especially vulnerable to addictive use of computer games due to their neuropsychological profile. Moreover excessive violent computer game playing might be a significant risk variable for aggressive behavior in the presence of personality traits with aggressive cognitions and behavior scripts in the consumers. Conclusions: The increasing clinical meaning of addictive computer games playing urgently necessitates the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical practice as well as the cooperation with allied disciplines.},

Such studies are needed because many characters in MMOs are customized avatars created by users, which may lead to different trends in character demographics. This content analysis examined representations of gender and race among 417 unique characters appearing 1,356 times in 20 hours of recorded content from four popular commercial MMOs, which was generated by five recruited users. Characters tended to be disproportionately male and white, with females and racial minorities appearing much less often.

abstract = {This thesis examines the potential of videogames as a medium for fostering critical thinking and discussion about social and personal problems. This analysis focuses on simulation as a representational form, which unlike others such as narrative, creates models that not only display the characteristics of the source system, but also reproduce its behavior by means of a set of rules. Therefore, videogames have the potential to represent reality not as a collection of images or texts, but as a dynamic system that can evolve and change. After studying how the process of interpretation functions in simulations, I propose to adapt the basic elements of the work of drama theorist Augusto Boal into videogame design. Boal created a set of techniques for participative theater that raises the spectators\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} awareness about their reality and encourages personal and social change. I propose two examples of how these goals could be attained by using videogames. One is based on a popular videogame that simulates suburban life. By modifying its design, I suggest ways for players to deconstruct the simulation\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s ideological assumptions and discuss alternative constructions that reflect their personal opinions. The second, uses videogame design in order to allow players to present their personal problems as unresolved simulations that will be shared and discussed among peers.},

The objective of these projects was to add definitive research in the area of game-based learning.
Three research studies were conducted at a national university to examine the difference in academic achievement among students who did and did not use video games in learning. Three different video games were added to approximately half the classes of freshmen Introduction to Business and Technology courses, 3rd year Economics courses, and 3rd year Management courses. Identical testing situations were used in all courses while data collected included game use, test scores, gender, ethnicity, and age. ANOVA, chi-squared, and t tests were used to test game
use effectiveness. Students in classes using the game scored significantly higher means than classes that did not.
There were no significant differences between genders, yet both genders scored significantly higher with game play.
There were no significant differences between ethnicities, yet all ethnic groups scored significantly higher with
game play. Students 40 years and under scored significantly higher with game play, while students 41 and older did not.

In the present study, the effects of playing a computer game and using a bright display on nocturnal sleep were examined in a laboratory. Seven male adults (24.7 +/- 5.6 years old) played exciting computer games with a bright display (game-BD) and a dark display (game-DD) and performed simple tasks with low mental load as a control condition in front of a BD (control-BD) and DD (control-DD) between 23:00 and 1:45 hours in randomized order and then went to bed at 2:00 hours and slept until 8:00 hours. Rectal temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate and subjective sleepiness were recorded before sleep and a polysomnogram was recorded during sleep. Heart rate was significantly higher after playing games than after the control conditions, and it was also significantly higher after using the BD than after using the DD. Subjective sleepiness and relative theta power of EEG were significantly lower after playing games than after the control conditions. Sleep latency was significantly longer after playing games than after the control conditions. REM sleep was significantly shorter after the playing games than after the control conditions. No significant effects of either computer games or BD were found on slow-wave sleep. These results suggest that playing an exciting computer game affects sleep latency and REM sleep but that a bright display does not affect sleep variables.},

abstract = {This article describes the development and assessment of a coding scheme for finding both usability and fun problems through observations of young children playing computer games during user tests. The proposed coding scheme is based on an existing list of breakdown indication types of the detailed video analysis method (DEVAN). This method was developed to detect usability problems in task-based products for adults. However, the new coding scheme for children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s computer games takes into account that in games, fun, in addition to usability, is an important factor and that children behave differently from adults. Therefore, the proposed coding scheme uses 8 of the 14 original breakdown indications and has 7 new indications. The article first discusses the development of the new coding scheme. Subsequently, the article describes the reliability assessment of the coding scheme. The any-two agreement measure of 38.5\% shows that thresholds for when certain user behavior is worth coding will be different for different evaluators. However, the any-two agreement of .92 for a fixed list of observation points shows that the distinction between the available codes is clear to most evaluators. Finally, a pilot study shows that training can increase any-two agreement considerably by decreasing the number of unique observations, in comparison with the number of agreed upon observations.},

One reason for this duality relates to the fact that researchers in gaming and simulation represent two distinct branches of science: the design and analytical sciences. The basic idea of the design sciences is to build and assess artifacts. The scientific method of the analytical sciences aims at developing and testing theories. Both pay attention to different notions of causality, and apply different criteria of success. This issue presents a framework both for artifact assessment and theory testing, which helps to better understand the distinct scientific and professional issues involved, and to offer directions for cross-fertilization.<br />

Studies of game elements in nongame contexts tend to describe full packages, with no way of assessing their individual psychological and functional impact. To isolate the effects of framing, students (N ¼ 90) were assigned to either discuss study environment issues through a list of questions, via a competitive discussion board game, or though the same game artifacts but with no game mechanics. Task engagement and self-reported intrinsic motivation were compared between groups. Results demonstrate that the effects of simply framing the activity as a game though vernacular and artifacts holds almost as much psycho- logical power as the full game mechanics. In both game conditions, interest and enjoyment were significantly superior to controls, but other intrinsic motivation variables remained unchanged. Implications for game design in nongame contexts are discussed, and a framework for differentiating ‘‘deep and shallow gamification’’ in terms of mechanics and framing is developed.},

While the primary purpose of games is entertainment, the underlying design employs a variety of strategies and techniques which require players to analyze, synthesize, and to use critical thinking skills. Ironically, these are also many of the same types of critical thinking skills educators and instructional designers attempt to foster when creating educational materials and media. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of a 3D game-based learning environment and to highlight some of the issues that arose during the design, development, and production. Specifically, this paper presents (a) game design elements which can be appropriated (looted) from game design, (b) cognitive research that supports the integration of the elements for instructional design, (c) a discussion of challenges encountered while creating a 3D game-based learning environment with limited resources, and (d) various low-cost and free resources (to avoid ninja looting).

abstract = {In areas such as Massively-Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), the conventional centralized server model does not scale with the sheer number of simultaneous clients that need to be supported. P2P architectures are increasingly being considered as replacements for traditional client-server architectures in MMOGs. A distributed P2P architecture that uses \&quot;Coordinator\&quot; nodes for handling smaller groups of players has been shown to be especially effective in supporting MMOGs. However, the drawback of moving from centralized to distributed architectures is the loss of control, and more specifically the increase in the vulnerability of the system as a whole to compromises. There has been no prior work on handling the specific case when the Coordinator itself is compromised and cheats, a scenario akin to cheating conducted by the network. We address this problem by proposing an architecture that is resilient to Coordinator compromises and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture. We believe that this is an essential step towards enabling a widespread deployment of P2P-based MMOGs.

Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

However, the magnitude of these effects was dependent on the method used to derive the expert referent structure. Moreover, knowledge structures mediated the relationship between general cognitive ability and skill-based performance.},

We hypothesized that a player will feel a higher sense of agency when making a choice if they foresee the available actions lead to meaningfully dif- ferent states.We experimentally tested our formalism’s ability to characterize choices that elicit a higher sense of agency and present evidence that supports our claim. Study participants (n = 88) played a choose-your-own- adventure game and reported a higher sense of agency when faced with choices that differed in situational con- tent over choices that didn’t, despite these choices dif- fering in non-situational ways.We contend our findings are a step toward principled approaches to the design of interactive stories that target specific cognitive and affective states.

Because implementing a computer game requires strong programming skills, game design courses are most often restricted to more advanced computer science students, yet real game design involves a diverse and creative team. This paper reports on a ready-made game design and experimentation framework, implemented in Java, which makes game programming more widely accessible. This framework, called Labyrinth, enables students at all programming skill levels to participate in computer game design. We describe the architecture of the framework, and discuss programming projects suitable for a wide variety of computer science courses, from capstone to non-major.

We exposed nine children who had TV- and VG-evoked seizures in daily life to 12 VG after standardized photic stimulation and pattern stimulation. Their EEGs were recorded continuously, analyzed, and then correlated with a video of their behavior. Similar types of clinical signs were seen during VG, P, and IPS, but the signs we observed were more subtle during the VG. Eight patients showed a clear lateralization. A new observation was the lowering of the eyelids to a state of half-closed. Our study suggests that the type of visual stimulus provoking a photoparoxysmal response or seizure is not particularly relevant. The children belonged to different epilepsy groups, and our findings add to the discussion on the boundaries of the epilepsy types.},

By examining successful stories, one can easily identify the strategic factors responsible for such a success, and the greater the success, the more evident those factors are. Timing, strategic positioning, pricing policies, lead-time - everything goes back to the place where it fits best, like a beautiful mosaic. Even competitors\&\#39; mistakes become more evident, their dull misunderstanding of what the winner was planning as every successful move leads to an even more successful one. The case of Sony PlayStation, the most successful digital games console ever, is no exception and the temptation to explain the rationale behind such an achievement is almost irresistible. As this paper tries to suggest, sometimes ex- post rationalizations hide or avoid part of the truth. Despite PlayStation\&\#39;s success, Sony\&\#39;s strategic choices were, on more than one occasion, driven more by lucky coincidence than by long-range planning. Furthermore, this paper shows how some of the strategic factors behind PlayStation\&\#39;s winning run sprang from decisions taken by lack of alternatives, and that only in the very end was Sony able to understand their full profit potential.

We critically appraised all studies.A total of 12 studies: three experiments with children with behavioural and emotional difficulties found increased aggression after watching aggressive as opposed to low-aggressive content television programmes, one found the opposite and two no clear effect, one found such children no more likely than controls to imitate aggressive television characters. One case-control study and one survey found that children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties watched more television than controls; another did not. Two studies found that children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties viewed more hours of aggressive television programmes than controls. One study on video game use found that young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties viewed more minutes of violence and played longer than controls. In a qualitative study children with behavioural and emotional difficulties, but not their parents, did not associate watching television with aggression. All studies had significant methodological flaws.

Accordingly, for a negative outcome focus condition (i.e., risk of losing a current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by positive distractors that were included in the game, whereas for a positive outcome focus (i.e., chance to improve one\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by negative distractors.

In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study contrasting a space-infringement game with a control task, males showed greater activation and functional connectivity compared to females in the mesocorticolimbic system. These findings may be attributable to higher motivational states in males, as well as gender differences in reward prediction, learning reward values and cognitive state during computer video games.

This paper will address why and how a reflexive and situated methodology could be employed to study cultural functions of play. Starting from the supposition that playing is pivotal to all game-research, I will follow Aarseth\&\#39;s claim that any (cultural) approach of games asks for an inclusion of the position of the player/researcher in its methodology. Being particularly interested in games as a cultural practice, I will add to his claim that for such kind of research a methodology is needed that enables us to see games as culture. My hypotheses will be that reflexivity and situatedness lie at the heart of any approach that wants to include both issues. I will show that reflexivity and situatedness may be needed as complementary tools to come to a cultural study of games that takes Aarseth\&\#39;s call for reflectivity serious. 
</p>
<p>
I will claim that the researcher needs the combined tools of reflexivity and situatedness because both situatedness (intertwining agent and environment) and reflexivity (distance/proximity) take into account the involvement of the researcher/player with its material and view this as a cultural praxis. Situatedness allows for game-research that shows the physical locality of playing whilst still relating play to a more global or national context. Reflexivity permits us to show how the researcher is culturally and locally involved in her quasi-object of study through play.

abstract = {A fundamental design question to ask in the development of a network game is - -Which transport protocol should be used - -TCP, UDP, or some other protocols? Seeking an objective answer to the choice of communication protocol for MMORPGs, we assess whether TCP, a popular choice, is suitable for MMORPGs based on empirical evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first evaluation of transport protocol performance using real-life game traces.We analyze a 1, 356-million-packet trace from ShenZhou Online, a TCP-based, commercial, mid-sized MMORPG. Our analysis indicates that TCP is unwieldy and inappropriate for MMORPGs. This is due to four distinctive characteristics of MMORPG traffic: 1) tiny packets, 2) low packet rate, 3) application-limited traffic generation, and 4) bidirectional traffic. We show that because TCP was originally designed for unidirectional and network-limited bulk data transfers, it cannot adapt well to MMORPG traffic. In particular, the window-based congestion control and the fast retransmit algorithm for loss recovery are ineffective. Furthermore, TCP is overkill, as not every game packet needs to be transmitted in a reliably and orderly manner. We also show that the degraded network performance did impact users\&\#39; willingness to continue a game. Finally, we discuss guidelines in designing transport protocols for online games.

Nevertheless, some people still use their mobile phones despite recognized safety concerns, legislation, and informal bans. Drawing potential predictors from the addiction literature, this study sought to predict usage and, specifically, problematic mobile phone use from extraversion, self-esteem, neuroticism, gender, and age. To measure problem use, the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale was devised and validated as a reliable self-report instrument, against the Addiction Potential Scale and overall mobile phone usage levels. Problem use was a function of age, extraversion, and low self-esteem, but not neuroticism. As extraverts are more likely to take risks, and young drivers feature prominently in automobile accidents, this study supports community concerns about mobile phone use, and identifies groups that should be targeted in any intervention campaigns.},

The release of new games or game-playing equipment, such as the PlayStation 2, generates great excitement and even buying frenzies. Yet, until now, this giant on the popular culture landscape has received little in-depth study or analysis. In this book, Mark J. P. Wolf and four other scholars conduct the first thorough investigation of the video game as an artistic medium. The book begins with an attempt to define what is meant by the term ""video game"" and the variety of modes of production within the medium. It moves on to a brief history of the video game, then applies the tools of film studies to look at the medium in terms of the formal aspects of space, time, narrative, and genre. The book also considers the video game as a cultural entity, object of museum curation, and repository of psychological archetypes. It closes with a list of video game research resources for further study.},

abstract = {Ten years after the groundbreaking From Barbie to Mortal Kombat highlighted the ways gender stereotyping and related social and economic issues permeate digital game play, the number of women and girl gamers has risen considerably. Despite this, gender disparities remain in gaming. Women may be warriors in World of Warcraft, but they are also scantily clad "booth babes" whose sex appeal is used to promote games at trade shows. Player-generated content has revolutionized gaming, but few games marketed to girls allow "modding" (game modifications made by players). Gender equity, the contributors to Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat argue, requires more than increasing the overall numbers of female players.

Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat brings together new media theorists, game designers, educators, psychologists, and industry professionals, including some of the contributors to the earlier volume, to look at how gender intersects with the broader contexts of digital games today: gaming, game industry and design, and serious games. The contributors discuss the rise of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) and the experience of girl and women players in gaming communities; the still male-dominated gaming industry and the need for different perspectives in game design; and gender concerns related to emerging serious games (games meant not only to entertain but also to educate, persuade, or change behavior). In today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s game-packed digital landscape, there is an even greater need for games that offer motivating, challenging, and enriching contexts for play to a more diverse population of players.},

Because NPCs are understudied to date, we attempt to show where and how normative frameworks are, even if unintended, working very much to marginalize women. Our primary focus is to determine if stereotypical associations between types of jobs and the bodies that are depicted performing these jobs are being reinforced.

Our findings show that while there are male and female NPCs for all professions, they are not equally represented. There is no statistically significant pattern linking gender and profession, however, males still make up approximately two thirds of the NPCs associated with a 'job' within this particular gameworld. There seems to be subtle hierarchies at work within the distribution of professions within World of Warcraft. For example, ideas of gender in the field of medicine have been transposed into the gameworld through the use of some male first aid NPCs having the title 'Doctor', and yet the title given to a female trainer of the same profession is 'Nurse'. Ultimately, we argue that there are other forces, influences and processes to consider when examining a sociotechnical system like World of Warcraft, including player preferences and conditioning, the fantasy lore upon which the game draws (as well as produces) and the general presentation of gender roles in the larger sociotechnical context.},

abstract = {Despite the emergence of computer games as a dominant cultural industry (and the accompanying emergence of computer games as the subject of scholarly research), we know little or nothing about the ethics of computer games. Considerations of the morality of computer games seldom go beyond intermittent portrayals of them in the mass media as training devices for teenage serial killers. In this first scholarly exploration of the subject, Miguel Sicart addresses broader issues about the ethics of games, the ethics of playing the games, and the ethical responsibilities of game designers. He argues that computer games are ethical objects, that computer game players are ethical agents, and that the ethics of computer games should be seen as a complex network of responsibilities and moral duties. Players should not be considered passive amoral creatures; they reflect, relate, and create with ethical minds. The games they play are ethical systems, with rules that create game worlds with values at play. Drawing on concepts from philosophy and game studies, Sicart proposes a framework for analyzing the ethics of computer games as both designed objects and player experiences. After presenting his core theoretical arguments and offering a general theory for understanding computer game ethics, Sicart offers case studies examining single-player games (using Bioshack as an example), multi player games (illustrated by Defcon), and online game worlds (illustrated by World of Warcraft) from an ethical perspective. He explores issues raised by unethical content in computer games and its possible effect on players and offers a synthesis of design theory and ethics that could be used as both analytical tool and inspiration in the creation of ethical game play.},

abstract = {We consider a model of game-theoretic network design initially studied by Anshelevich et al. (Proceedings of the 45th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), pp. 295-304, 2004), where selfish players select paths in a network to minimize their cost, which is prescribed by Shapley cost shares. If all players are identical, the cost share incurred by a player for an edge in its path is the fixed cost of the edge divided by the number of players using it. In this special case, Anshelevich et al. (Proceedings of the 45th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), pp. 295-304, 2004) proved that pure-strategy Nash equilibria always exist and that the price of stability-the ratio between the cost of the best Nash equilibrium and that of an optimal solution-is I similar to(log k), where k is the number of players. Little was known about the existence of equilibria or the price of stability in the general weighted version of the game. Here, each player i has a weight w (i) a parts per thousand yen1, and its cost share of an edge in its path equals w (i) times the edge cost, divided by the total weight of the players using the edge.This paper presents the first general results on weighted Shapley network design games. First, we give a simple example with no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. This motivates considering the price of stability with respect to alpha-approximate Nash equilibria-outcomes from which no player can decrease its cost by more than an alpha multiplicative factor. Our first positive result is that O(log w (max) )-approximate Nash equilibria exist in all weighted Shapley network design games, where w (max) is the maximum player weight. More generally, we establish the following trade-off between the two objectives of good stability and low cost: for every alpha=Omega(log w (max) ), the price of stability with respect to O(alpha)-approximate Nash equilibria is O((log W)/alpha), where W is the sum of the players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} weights. In particular, there is always an O(log W)-approximate Nash equilibrium with cost within a constant factor of optimal.Finally, we show that this trade-off curve is nearly optimal: we construct a family of networks without o(log w (max) / log log w (max) )-approximate Nash equilibria, and show that for all alpha=Omega(log w (max) /log log w (max) ), achieving a price of stability of O(log W/alpha) requires relaxing equilibrium constraints by an Omega(alpha) factor.},

abstract = {PC-based games are increasingly being used for military training domains. Proponents of training games argue that
younger Soldiers are part of the \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}digital\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} generation, and having grown up playing videogames they will respond
positively to their use in training. However, in a series of research projects we\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}ve found that these assumptions may be overstated. This paper covers two research efforts that analyzed Soldiers\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} videogame experience, as well as the impact of trainees\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} prior experience on training outcomes. The first project surveyed a total of 777 first-year U. S. Military Academy Cadets who participated in a team tactics training exercise using America\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Army, over two years. Results across both years indicated that 60\% of Cadets had limited or no videogame experience in the prior year. Additionally, the amount and type of prior gaming experience correlated with training outcomes (i.e.,
performance, training satisfaction, motivation, and time on task). A second project assessed the frequency that Soldiers of all ranks play videogames compared to engagement in other recreational activities. Results suggest that fewer than 32\% of over 10,000 U.S. Army Soldiers surveyed across various ranks play videogames recreationally on a weekly basis (numbers vary by rank). For the ranks with the highest frequency (E2-E4), only about 42-52\% play commercial videogames on at least a weekly basis; whereas, more senior enlisted ranks and Officers/Warrant Officers play videogames far less frequently (5-30\%). Consistently, our research shows that the assumption that most Soldiers are gamers is exaggerated. Continuing to act on this assumption can be troublesome unless certain precautions are taken.},

Although we view stories as passive and linear, and games as active and nonlinear, during both types of experience, a participant (or guest) is mentally active, and having a linear experience. The way to gauge the quality of the guest's experience is through a system of interest curves, which measure interest over time, and interest is shown to be made of three components: inherent interest, poetry of presentation, and psychological proximity. Finally, this paper introduces the idea of indirect control, which is a method of secretly controlling the desires of a guest, allowing a designer to imbue a non-linear interactive experience with structures typically used in traditional storytelling.},

Nowadays, quite a few video games have women in leading parts; Tomb Raider\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Lara Croft is the prototypical example. In our study we investigated the so-called \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}Lara phenomenon,\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} that is, the appearance of a competent female character in a dominant position. We also studied the portrayal of men and the race of both male and female characters. We did a content analysis on the introductory films of 12 contemporary video games.

Most game characters belonged to the dominant White race, the heroes exclusively so.},

Hemodynamics were measured at rest and during four stressors (ie, postural change, car driving simulation, video game, forehead cold). Echocardiographic-derived measures of LVM were indexed separately to body surface area and height(2,7). Controlling for age and race differences (ie, 74\% of African Americans v, 47\% of whites had positive FH), the positive FH group exhibited greater LVM/height(2,7), LVM/body surface area, higher systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) and lower cardiac index at rest (P < .05 for all). The positive FH group also displayed higher peak SEP or DBP and higher TPRI increases to each stressor and came from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds (P < .05 for all). Regression analyses indicated that FH of EH was not a significant determinant of LVM/height(2,7) after accounting for contributions of gender (greater in men), general adiposity, resting cardiac index and blood pressure (BP), and TPRI responsivity to video game and cold stimulation (P < .05 for all). Thus, greater LVM index; in positive FH of EH youth appears in part related to their greater BP and TPRI at rest and during stress. },

abstract = {This study explores the effect of interaction in research on knowledge creation (KC) and its dependence on the conceptualization of a human being. A framework for understanding KC with hermeneutic phenomenology is developed, based on an analysis of recent KC research and key texts on hermeneutic phenomenology. The results obtained indicate that recent KC research still emphasizes the concept of knowledge as an asset inside the human mind, although the interest is in knowing and interpersonal relationships in working communities. Exploration of the use of the effect of interaction in research on KC shows that successful interaction is connected to the ideas of openness, critical thinking, and awareness of past experiences. These elements reflect the general ideas of the hermeneutic tradition without taking into account the historical roots of hermeneutics or questioning the concept of a human being behind them. It is concluded that the hermeneutic circle and phenomenological conceptualization of a human being provide a better defined and more coherent structure for understanding the event of KC as a future-oriented, conscious act of interaction. The frame- work developed offers three fundamental areas for exploration: structure of the interactive event, construction of the human experience in interaction, and modes of being in interaction.},

abstract = {In recent years, an aging demographic majority in the Western world has come to the attention of the game industry. The recently released \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}brain-training\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} games target this population, and research investigating gameplay experience of the elderly using this game form is lacking. This study employs a 2\{$\backslash$texttimes\}2 mixed factorial design (age group: young and old\{$\backslash$texttimes\}game form: paper and Nintendo DS) to investigate effects of age and game form on usability, self-assessment, and gameplay experience in a supervised field study. Effectiveness was evaluated in task completion time, efficiency as error rate, together with self-assessment measures (arousal, pleasure, dominance) and game experience (challenge, flow, competence, tension, positive and negative affect). Results indicate players, regardless of age, are more effective and efficient using pen-and-paper than using a Nintendo DS console. However, the game is more arousing and induces a heightened sense of flow in digital form for gamers of all ages. Logic problem\{$\backslash$textendash\}solving challenges within digital games may be associated with positive feelings for the elderly but with negative feelings for the young. Thus, digital logic-training games may provide positive gameplay experience for an aging Western civilization.},

abstract = {Objective.-We examined how household factors that mediate television access are associated with screen time (television, videos, movies, and computer and video games), reading, and homework. Methods.-We conducted a self-report survey among 1197 sixth and seventh graders in 10 middle schools in 4 Boston-area communities in 1995. To assess independent associations, SUDAAN linear regressions were calculated to control for respondent characteristics and household access and to account for clustered sampling in the school-based design. Results.-Total viewing (television, videos, movies, and computer and video games) averaged 3.35 +/- 2.2 hours per day. In multivariate regressions, independent direct associations with total viewing were observed for the following categories: youth has a television in the bedroom: 0.64 hours per day (P < .001), never/seldom has family dinners: 0.55 hours (P < .01), no parental limits on television time: 0.48 hours (P < .01): and each additional television outside the youth\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s bedroom, 0.12 hours (P < .05). Similar results held when television/video/niovie use was examined separately from computer/video game use. Youth reported an average of 1.6 +/- 1.1 hours of reading and homework per day, Parental limits on television time were associated with 0.21 hours more reading per day (P < .01), whereas a television in the bedroom was associated with 0.18 hours less (P < .01). Conclusions.- Reducing intrahousehold television access may enhance clinical, school, and Community strategies to reduce youth television viewing and other screen time.},

abstract = {We examined the causal relationship between playing violent video games and increases in aggressiveness by using implicit measures of aggressiveness, which have become important for accurately predicting impulsive behavioral tendencies. Ninety-six adults were randomly assigned to play one of three versions of a computer game that differed only with regard to game content (violent, peaceful, or abstract game), or to work on a reading task. In the games the environmental context, mouse gestures, and physiological arousal-as indicated by heart rate and skin conductance-were kept constant. In the violent game soldiers had to be shot, in the peaceful game sunflowers had to be watered, and the abstract game simply required clicking colored triangles. Five minutes of play did not alter trait aggressiveness, yet an Implicit Association Test detected a change in implicit aggressive self-concept. Playing a violent game produced a significant increase in implicit aggressive self-concept relative to playing a peaceful game. The well-controlled study closes a gap in the research on the causality of the link between violence exposure in computer games and aggressiveness with specific regard to implicit measures. We discuss the significance of importing recent social-cognitive theory into aggression research and stress the need for further development of aggression-related implicit measures.},

abstract = {Background: Neck-shoulder pain (NSP) and low back pain (LBP) increased among adolescents in the 1990s and the beginning of 2000. A potential risk factor for this increase is the use of information and communication technology. We studied how the use of computers, the Internet, and mobile phones, playing digital games and viewing television are related to NSP and LBP in adolescents. Methods: Mailed survey with nationally representative samples of 14-, 16-, and 18-year-old Finns in 2003 (n = 6003, response rate 68\%). The outcome variables were weekly NSP and LBP. Results: NSP was perceived by 26\% and LBP by 12\%. When compared with non-users, the risk of NSP was 1.3 (adjusted odds ratios) when using computers > 2-3 h/day, and 1.8 when using 4-5 h/day; 2.5 when using computers >= 42 h/week, and 1.7 when using the Internet >= 42 h/week. Compared with non-users, the risk of LBP was 2.0 when using computers > 5 h/day, 1.7 when using >= 42 h/week, 1.8 when using the Internet >= 42 h/week, and 2.0 when playing digital games > 5 h/day. Times spent on digital gaming, viewing television, and using mobile phones were not associated with NSP, nor were use of mobile phones and viewing television with LBP after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusions: Frequent computer-related activities are an independent risk factor for NSP and LBP. Daily use of computers exceeding 2-3 h seems to be a threshold for NSP and exceeding 5 h for LBP. Computer-related activities may explain the increase of NSP and LBP in the 1990s and the beginning of 2000.},

abstract = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children’s and adolescents’ lives, with 97\% playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of “gaming” has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is impor- tant, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming in- creasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and so- cial. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a the- oretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.},

abstract = {Designing and developing an interactive narrative experience includes development of story content as well as a visual composition plan for visually realizing the story content. Theatre directors, filmmakers, and animators have emphasized the importance of visual design. Choices of character placements, lighting configuration, and camera movements, have been documented by designers to have direct impact on communicating the narrative, evoking emotions and moods, and engaging viewers. Many research projects focused on adapting the narrative content to the interaction, yet little attention was given to adapting the visual presentation. In this paper, I present a new approach to interactive narrative \{$\backslash$textendash\} an approach based on filmmaking theory. I propose an interactive narrative architecture, that in addition to dynamically selecting narrative events that suit the continuously changing situation, it automatically, and in real-time, reconfigures the visual design integrating camera movements, lighting modulation, and character movements. The architecture utilizes rules extracted from filmmaking, cinematography, and visual arts theories. I argue that such adaptation will lead to increased engagement and enriched interactive narrative experience.},

abstract = {Even if golf video games provide no proprioceptive afferences on actual putting movement, they may give sufficient substitutive visual cues to enhance force control in this skill. It was hypothesized that this usefulness requires, however, two conditions: the video game must provide reliable demonstrations of actual putts, and the user must want to use the game to make progress in actual putting. Accordingly, a video game was selected on the basis of its fidelity to the real-world game. It allowed two different methods of adjusting the virtual player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s putting force in order to hole a putt: an analogue method that consisted of focusing on the virtual player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s movement and a symbolic method that consisted of focusing on the movement of a gauge on a scale representing the virtual player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s putting force. The participants had to use one of these methods with either the intention of making progress in actual putting or in a second condition to simply enjoy the game. Results showed a positive transfer of video playing to actual putting skill for the learning group and also, to a lesser degree, for the enjoyment group; but only when they used the symbolic method. Results are discussed in the context of how vision may convey force cues in sports video games.},

Therefore, a story writer must write fragments of computer code for the hundreds or thousands of NPCs in the game world. The challenge is to create entertaining and non-repetitive behaviors for the NPCs without investing substantial programming effort to write custom non-trivial scripts for each NPC. Current computer games have simplistic ambient behaviors for NPCs; it is rare for NPCs to interact with each other. In this paper, we describe how generative behavior patterns can be used to quickly and reliably generate ambient behavior scripts that are believable, entertaining and non-repetitive, even for the more difficult case of interacting NPCs.

abstract = {This article considers the media phenomenon of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}history\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} over the past decade. In particular I am interested in the complex types of historical engagement available, and what these various models of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}experience\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} suggest for consumption and understanding of the past. Analysing re-enactment, \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}reality\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} history TV and first-person shooter (FPS) computer games, I suggest that engagement with the discourse of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}history\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} in popular culture is a complicated and problematic issue. I further suggest that these models offer the professional academic historian a number of interesting methodological and epistemological paradigms. All three of the media I consider refuse to fit into specific, disciplined or institutionalised order. Their dynamism and levels of complexity are crucial to their consumption. Analysis of history-as-experience illustrates that it is a set of narratives divorced from an institutionalised framework, used in different and dissident ways by a variety of social groups. These uses interact with the notion of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}history\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} as an academic pursuit but also create a space between ontological and intellectual approaches to the past. On the one hand increased access and interrogation of historical narratives suggests an enfranchising of the population into history; on the other the factuality of history organises and disciplines.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of AI, mind games have been studied as relevant application fields. Nowadays, some programs are better than human players in most classical games. Their results highlight the efficiency of AI methods that are now quite standard. Such methods are very useful to Go programs, but they do not enable a strong Go program to be built. The problems related to Computer Go require new AI problem solving methods. Given the great number of problems and the diversity of possible solutions, Computer Go is an attractive research domain for AI. Prospective methods of programming the game of Go will probably be of interest in other domains as well. The goal of this paper is to present Computer Go by showing the links between existing studies on Computer Go and different AI related domains: evaluation function, heuristic search, machine learning, automatic knowledge generation, mathematical morphology and cognitive science. In addition, this paper describes both the practical aspects of Go programming, such as program optimization, and various theoretical aspects such as combinatorial game theory, mathematical morphology, and Monte-Carlo methods.},

abstract = {Background: There is growing social concern about school violence but little is known about how this situation is experienced in the schools. The objective of this study was to know the perception that School\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s head masters have of the school-based hostility, on their causes, how they value current preventive strategies, and their recommendations to develop future preventive interventions. Methods: We conducted an exploratory study with 14 semi-structured interviews of School\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s head masters. Interviews were conducted at the Schools between May and June 2003 in I independent school, 9 state comprehensive schools, and 4 other comprehensive schools within the city of Alicante. Results: The perception of the head masters is that the prevalence of violence is low, more verbal than physical and within gender. They identify lack of punctuality, absenteeism and lack of interest as forms of hostility. As causes they identified age, family problems, school environment, society, media (TV and video-games) and poor language skills. Preventive methods in use were, on one hand, extra-lessons and transversal contents foreseen in the Education Law and common to all schools, and, on the other hand, ideological and pedagogical contents which were specific of some centres. Recommendations focused in demands for increased economic support and skilled human resources. Conclusions: School-based violence is not perceived as an alarming school issue, nor by its magnitude neither by the immediate causes and students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} characteristics to which it is associated. A heavier emphasis is placed on external and environmental causes perceived as much more difficult to confront.},

abstract = {Many commercial computer games allow a team of players to match their skills against another team, controlled by humans or by the computer. Most players prefer human opponents, since the artificial intelligence of a computer-controlled team is in general inferior. An adaptive mechanism for team-oriented artificial intelligence would allow computer-controlled opponents to adapt to human player behaviour, thereby providing a means of dealing with weaknesses in the game AI. Current commercial computer games lack challenging adaptive mechanisms. This paper proposes \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}TEAM\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, a novel team-oriented adaptive mechanism which is inspired by evolutionary algorithms. The performance of TEAM is evaluated in an experiment involving an actual commercial computer game (the Capture The Flag team-based game mode of the popular commercial computer game Quake III). The experimental results indicate that TEAM succeeds in endowing computer-controlled opponents with successful adaptive performance. We therefore conclude that TEAM can be successfully applied to generate challenging adaptive opponent behaviour in team-oriented commercial computer games.},

The analysis focuses on the use of racial slurs and the contingencies of historical re-representation in war games; the limited representation of black masculinity in sports games and the romanticization of \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}ghetto play\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} in urban street games; and the pathologization and fetishization of race in \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}crime sim\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} action-adventure games such as True Crime: Streets of LA.

The objective of this study was to determine what pediatric residency programs are teaching trainees about media and the influence of media on the physical and mental health of children and adolescents. Design. Survey of residency curricula, consisting of 17 items about children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s exposure to media, including television, movies, popular music, computer/video games and the Internet, the effects of this exposure on specific health risks, and associations between program characteristics and media education in the residency curriculum. Participants. Directors of the 209 accredited pediatric residency programs in the United States. Results. Two hundred four programs (97.6\%) responded. Fifty-eight programs (28.4\%) offered formal education on 1 or more types of media; 60 programs (29.4\%) discussed the influences of media when teaching about specific health conditions. Residents in 96 programs (47.1\%) were encouraged to discuss media use with patients and parents; 13 programs (6.4\%) taught media literacy as an intervention. Among program characteristics, only media training received by program directors was significantly associated with inclusion of media in residency curricula. Conclusions. Despite increasing awareness of media influence on child health, less than one-third of US pediatric residency programs teach about media exposure. Developing a pediatric media curriculum and training pediatric residency directors or designated faculty may be a resource-effective means of improving health for children growing up in a media-saturated environment.},

abstract = {Playing action video games enhances several different aspects of visual processing; however, the mechanisms underlying this improvement remain unclear. Here we show that playing action video games can alter fundamental characteristics of the visual system, such as the spatial resolution of visual processing across the visual field. To determine the spatial resolution of visual processing, we measured the smallest distance a distractor could be from a target without compromising target identification. This approach exploits the fact that visual processing is hindered as distractors are brought close to the target, a phenomenon known as crowding. Compared with nonplayers, action-video-game players could tolerate smaller target-distractor distances. Thus, the spatial resolution of visual processing is enhanced in this population. Critically, similar effects were observed in non-video-game players who were trained on an action video game; this result verifies a causative relationship between video-game play and augmented spatial resolution.},

By dissecting the implicit value judgments motivating different definitions of ‘‘game,’’ the underlying aesthetic positions can be excavated, revealing a conceptual landscape of the aesthetics of play. Analysis of various definitions for game provided by both professional game designers and academics allows the identification of distinct aesthetic camps. These include (but are not restricted to) victory, prob- lem, reward, imaginative, social, and uncertainty aesthetics. Additionally, a variety of refinements to these positions can be identified. Collectively, these aesthetic posi- tions outline an answer to the question raised by Mary Midgley’s observation that games and art can be unified because they deal with human needs that necessarily have a structure. This article provides a rough sketch of the shape of human play needs and asserts that the unity that can thus be attained must necessarily be diverse.},

Observing that appliances made for us to "enjoy labor," as one adversary in a recent Nintendo Wii title puts it, have a history, I show that hyperindustrial recreational appliances like the Wii design wonder for learning and play by deploying gestural-technical stylistics first prototyped in human-computer interaction design research. I apply ten stylistics of gestural interaction design to the Wii in order to articulate its differences from other interactive educational, recreational, and health devices. I conclude that the Wii increases bandwidth for player action with two distinct effects. First, it orients "wonder" as gestural-technical conduct, making an ethical claim to differentiate contemporary play and work, while, second, projecting an unprogrammed "signature effect" extended in a range of modifications by researchers and amateurs alike.},

"Toward a Ludic Architecture" is a pioneering publication, architecturally framing play and games as human practices in and of space. Filling the gap in literature, Steffen P. Walz considers game design theory and practice alongside architectural theory and practice, asking: how are play and games architected? What kind of architecture do they produce and in what way does architecture program play and games? What kind of architecture could be produced by playing and gameplaying? "Toward a Ludic Architecture" is a must-read for analyzing and designing play and games from an architectural standpoint. Such a contribution is particularly applicable in an era when games extend into physical, designed space that is increasingly permeated by devices, sensors, and information networks, allowing for rules and fictions to superimpose our everyday environments. Including a maze-like, episodic, and critical discussion of interweaving "play-grounds," "Toward a Ludic Architecture" is a playful look at the conceptual space of play and games.},

abstract = {Contextual interference is a learning paradox associated with enhanced long-term memory and transfer when learning multiple, similar skills. The performance benefits of contextual interference have been demonstrated frequently. This study examines the influence of a participant characteristic (trait cognitive anxiety) on the learning of multiple related skills in a contextual interference paradigm. Contextual interference effects were tested by controlling for individual differences in trait cognitive anxiety when learning sport-oriented computer games. Undergraduate sport management majors ((N) under bar =20) completed the Sport Anxiety Scale (Smith et al, 1990). Then they played a computer game simulating the events of the winter Olympics. Participants were randomly assigned to either a random or blocked practice schedule, practicing 72 training trials of three events in two testing sessions. Delayed retention and transfer tests were performed after a four-day interval. The dependent variable was time taken to complete an event. An ANCOVA model, using trait cognitive anxiety as a covariate, showed participants in random ((M) under bar (adjusted)=247sec) were significantly faster ((p) under bar <0.05) than participants in blocked practice schedules (<(M)under bar>(adjusted)=281sec) during transfer. However, during acquisition and retention, random and blocked participants performed similarly. Results extend previous contextual interference findings and are discussed in terms of the implications of these findings on contextual interference and cognitive anxiety in an interdisciplinary framework.},

Therefore, we tested the effects of a classroom intervention to reduce television, videotape, and video game use on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s toy purchase requests, in a school-based randomized controlled trial. Third- and fourth-grade children (mean age, 8.9 years) in two socio-demographically and scholastically matched public elementary schools were eligible to participate. Children in one randomly selected elementary school received an 18-lesson, 6-month classroom curriculum to reduce television, videotape, and video game use. In both schools, in September (before intervention) and April (after intervention) of a single school year, children and parents reported children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s prior week\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s purchase requests for toys seen on television. After intervention, children in the intervention school were significantly less likely to report toy purchase requests than children in the control school, with adjusting for baseline purchase requests, gender, and age (odds ratio, 0.29; 95\% confidence interval, 0.12-0.69). Among intervention school children, reductions in self-reported purchase requests were also associated with reductions in television viewing. There was no significant difference between schools in parent reports of children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s requests for toy purchases. These findings suggest that reducing television viewing is a promising approach to reducing the influences of advertising on children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s behavior.},

I conclude by asserting that the unreal enemy of America\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Army is, ultimately, an enemy that is not exclusive to a video game, but one that exists as an anonymous specter, ever present in the militarized American cultural imaginary.},

The first myth is that Kant's early pre-critical writings are uninteresting dogmatic juvenelia written when Kant was under the spell of Leibniz and Wolff. On the contrary, I find the pre-critical works interesting both in their own right and for understanding the origins of Kant's celebrated critical system of philosophy. I also believe that, from his very first writings, the pre-critical Kant broke from both Leibniz and Wolff. The second myth is that Kant, as the paradigm of "Enlightenment rationality" either ignored or evinced a hostile disdain for philospohical issues connected with our embodiment. Although I am sympatethic with the feminist critics who push this line, I believe that in this case they are dead wrong. Despite appereances, Kant was very much concerned with the philosophical significance of embodiment. I think that this concern manifested itself throughout Kant's career, although I admit that it is most evident in the relatively litle-know early and late works.},

Existing conventional user interface modeling approaches are not sufficient, as they do not cover the media-specific aspects of the application. However, a multimedia application usually includes conventional user interface elements as well. Thus, we first propose a solution for the media-specific part. Second, we elaborate an integration of our approach with existing conventional approaches. Finally, we discuss the overall model-driven development approach and outline its benefits.},

The author uses theories about media and emotion as well as theories about emotion as a process to develop a model for the unfolding of emotion in violent video games. It is argued that violent video games provide a gratifying context for the experience of emotions. The fact that gamers are largely in control of the game implies that they can voluntarily select the emotional situations they confront. This freedom is attractive for adolescents who are in the midst of constructing an identity. For them, the violent game is a safe, private laboratory where they can experience different emotions, including those that arc controversial in ordinary life. Gamers may deliberately select emotions that sustain dominant masculine identity (e.g., anger), as well as emotions that are at odds with dominant masculinity (e.g., fear).},

This article reports on the first ever explorative survey (N = 760) conducted among players of The Sims2. Our study combined social role theory with gender and games theorizing to enable us to understand gender differences in play. We focused on gender differences in motivation for playing The Sims2, employing uses and gratifications as our guiding theory. Our results revealed that most of our participants were indeed female. The significantly higher score of male players on the challenge motive was anticipated by social role theory, but their higher score on social interaction was unexpected. Accordingly, we discuss the implications of our results for uses and gratifications theory as well as the necessity to investigate actual practices of play in more detail.},

abstract = {Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based optical technique is becoming the right choice for the next-generation Internet infrastructure to transport high-speed Internet Protocol traffic. Today, wireless asynchronous transfer mode (WATM) network plays the leading role; undoubtedly it will be replaced with wireless WDM (WWDM) network to provide higher quality of service for mobile users. In addition many conventional and emerging applications, such as teleconferencing and distributed games, require multicasting increasingly. Many efforts to support multicasting for WATM networks have been offered, yet there are rarely addressed on WWDM networks. Moreover, conventional operations to set up and tear down optical connections in WDM networks are unable to apply directly to WWDM networks. User\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s mobility may make the operating optical-multicast-tree to change into very inefficient. The tree may expand and consume excessive resources, and even lost connection due to violating the associated QoS constraints. In this paper, a Constrained Optical Tree Migration Scheme (COTMS) is proposed to support real-time multicast services for WWDM networks. COTMS efficiently deals with the constrained tree migration problem and adapts easily to the operations of WDM. Simulation results reveal that COTMS can markedly reduce the resources used by per optical tree, thus achieving both low handoff-dropping/join-blocking rate and high-resource utilization.

abstract = {Motion capture-based facial animation has recently gained popularity in many applications, such as movies, video games, and human-computer interface designs. With the use of sophisticated facial motions from a human performer, animated characters are far more lively and convincing. However, editing motion data is difficult, limiting the potential of reusing the motion data for different tasks. To address this problem, statistical techniques have been applied to learn models of the facial motion in order to derive new motions based on the existing data. Most existing research focuses on audio-to-visual mapping and reordering of words, or on photo-realistically matching the synthesized face to the original performer. Little attention has been paid to modifying and controlling facial expression, or to mapping expressive motion onto other 3D characters. This article describes a method for creating expressive facial animation by extracting information from the expression axis of a speech performance. First, a statistical model for factoring the expression and visual speech is learned from video. This model can be used to analyze the facial expression of a new performance or modify the facial expressions of an existing performance. With the addition of this analysis of the facial expression, the facial motion can be more effectively retargeted to another 3D face model. The blendshape retargeting technique is extended to include subsets of morph targets that belong to different facial expression groups. The proportion of each subset included in a final animation is weighted according to the expression information. The resulting animation conveys much more emotion than if only the motion vectors were used for retargeting. Finally, since head motion is very important in adding liveness to facial animation, we introduces an audio-driven synthesis technique for generating new head motion.},

Studies on the effect of cognitive distraction during the preoperative period are lacking. We evaluated the efficacy of an interactive distraction, a hand-held video game (VG) in reducing preoperative anxiety in children. Methods: In a randomized, prospective study of 112 children aged 4-12 years undergoing outpatient surgery, anxiety was assessed after admission and again at mask induction of anesthesia, using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). Postoperative behavior changes were assessed with the Posthospital Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ). Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: parent presence (PP), PP + a hand-held VG, and PP + 0.5 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam (M) given > 20 min prior to entering the operating room. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in anxiety (P < 0.01) in groups M and PP at induction of anesthesia compared with baseline, but not in VG group. VG patients demonstrated a decrease in anxiety from baseline (median change in mYPAS -3), the difference compared with PP (+11.8) was significant (P = 0.04). The change in anxiety in the M group (+7.3) was not statistically different from other groups. Sixty-three percent of patients in VG group had no change or decrease in anxiety after treatment, compared with 26\% in M group and 28\% in PP group (P = 0.01). There was no difference in anxiety changes between female and male patients. Conclusions: A hand-held VG can be offered to most children as a low cost, easy to implement, portable, and effective method to reduce anxiety in the preoperative area and during induction of anesthesia. Distraction in a pleasurable and familiar activity provides anxiety relief, probably through cognitive and motor absorption.},

Departing from this ideal, activism is approached in terms of processes of identification by establishing conflictual frontiers to outside others as either adversaries or enemies. On the basis of these discussions, we outline a typology of four kinds of activists, namely the salon activist, the contentious activist, the law-abiding activist and the Gand- hian activist. The typology’s first axis, between antagonism and agonism, is derived from normative discussions in radical democracy concerning developing frontiers. The second axis, about readi- ness to engage in civil disobedience, is derived from a review of studies of different forms of online activism. The article concludes by suggesting that the different forms of political engagement online have to be taken into account when studying how online activism can contribute to social change.},

The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology for computer game design with the goal of creating games that increase the consumer\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s satisfaction. Too often, game designers create games that satisfy their own perceptions of a good game without considering the needs of the consumers that will play the games. Customer driven computer game design applies the critical incident technique as a means to define the elements of good and bad game. A methodology is described whereby game designers establish the goal and intentions of the game by listening to the voice of the consumer. The concept was tested by distributing CIT surveys to active game players who each wrote two stories about their game playing behavior and experiences. The first story described the respondent\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s best experience playing games and the second story described their worst experience. The stories were archived and content analyzed using Gremler\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s best-practice methods for identifying categories and critical incidents. A summary sheet describing the frequency of good and bad incidents was derived by three coders. The respondents\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} original game playing stories were further abstracted into key good and bad descriptions and appended to the summary CIT frequency data sheet to create a consumer game report. The report was then used by creative designers as a reference point for designing new games.},

It is my understanding that both Florida’s and Wright’s work share and emphasize certain cultural values, including cities’ personalities. The analysis reveals how significantly the existence of happiness is linked to place in contemporary cultural setting, although Florida and Wright seem to disagree on how exactly they may relate. Furthermore, critiques of Florida also evoke criticism of the game’s suppositions. Through interpreting SimCity’s application in pedagogy, its educational value is tied to discussions of in-game assumptions which promote academic critical inquiry. The conclusion frames the game as a simulation or model in game and play theory and problematizes Wright’s intention to build elaborate models based on assumptions, which players as potential urban planners absorb and emulate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated whether making access to sedentary activities contingent on physical activity would increase physical activity. DESIGN: Experimental. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four obese children aged 8 - 12 y were randomized to one of three groups in which children had to accumulate 750 or 1500 pedometer counts to earn 10 min of access to video games or movies, or to a control group in which access to sedentary behaviors was provided noncontingently. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity in the 20 min experimental session was measured by electronic pedometer and triaxial accelerometer (ie TriTrac(R)). Activity liking was measured by visual analog scales. Anthropometric and demographic characteristics were also assessed. RESULTS: Children in the 750 and 1500 count contingency groups engaged in significantly more physical activity and spent more time in moderate intensity activity or higher compared with controls. Children in the Contingent 1500 group engaged in more activity and spent more time in moderate or greater intensity activity compared to children in the Contingent 750 group. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that contingent access to sedentary activities can reinforce physical activity in obese children, and changes in physical activity level depend in part on the targeted physical activity goal.},

Using schematized visual sketches similar to cross-cultural facial universals (Ekman, 1999), Mimics (Shmelyov \& Aidman, 1997) employs a computer-game-like scenario that requires the subject to identify with an avatar and navigate it through a playing field inhabited by hosts who display a range of facial expressions. From these expressions (which are highly consequential), the player has to anticipate the hosts\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} reactions to the avatar (which may vary from friendly to obstructing or aggressive) and choose between negotiating with a host (by altering the avatar\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s facial expression), attacking it, or searching for an escape route. Comprehensive recording of player moves and interactions has enabled computation of several fine-grained indices of interactive behavior, such as aggressive response styles, efficiency, and motivation in conflict/cooperation contexts. Initial validation data and potential applications of the method in the assessment of personality and social behavior are discussed.},

Event-related changes in zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity and skin conductance level (SCL) were recorded, and the participants rated their emotions and the trait psychoticism based on the Psychoticism dimension of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Short Form. Wounding and killing the opponent elicited an increase in SCL and a decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity. The decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi activity was less pronounced among high Psychoticism scorers compared with low Psychoticism scorers. The wounding and death of the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s own character (James Bond) elicited an increase in SCL and zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity and a decrease in corrugator activity.

The AI system was designed to satisfy goals based on lessons learned from previous projects and work within the constraints of developing a commercial title for videogame consoles. The main goals were to have: a modular behavior system able to support a large variety of behaviors, memory-efficient and robust saved games, many distinct NPC types with different styles of movement and combat, fast and robust pathfinding, robust movement and collision, and modular steering behaviors. The goals were largely met, though some issues became apparent in the course of development, primarily difficulties for designers with setting up movement graphs and NPC logic.

abstract = {Distributed virtual environments (DVEs) are distributed systems that allow multiple geographically distributed clients (users) to interact simultaneously in a computer-generated, shared virtual world. Applications of DVEs can be seen in many areas nowadays, such as online games, military simulations, collaborative designs, etc. To support large-scale DVEs with real-time interactions among thousands or even more distributed clients, a geographically distributed server architecture (GDSA) is generally needed, and the virtual world can be partitioned into many distinct zones to distribute the load among the servers. Due to the geographic distributions of clients and servers in such architectures, it is essential to efficiently assign the participating clients to servers to enhance users\&\#39; experience in interacting within the DVE. This problem is termed the client assignment problem (CAP) in this paper. We propose a two-phase approach, consisting of an initial assignment phase and a refined assignment phase to address the CAP. Both phases are shown to be NP-hard. Several heuristic assignment algorithms are then devised and evaluated via extensive simulations with realistic settings. We find that, even under heterogeneous environments like the Internet where accurate input data for the assignment algorithms are usually impractical to obtain, the proposed algorithms are still beneficial to the performances of DVE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the issue of presence in the virtual environment. In particular, we discuss the
question of aesthetic realism in computer games, and try to evaluate its importance in regard to different
elements of playability that generate a sensation of immersion or presence. What we demonstrate, mainly
through the analysis of interviews of Quake players and observations of their activity during lan-parties, is that
players are driven by multi-dimensional pleasures in games, and that realism is far from being enough for
enjoyment. The main qualities in a game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s universe can be described as "a change of scenery" in different ways:
the senses must be surprised (by sounds as much as images), there must be a cognitive challenge in the discovery
of the laws of the universe (some laws are implicit and require training, like being able to evaluate if one can
jump across a given river), social life must be slightly complex and, if possible, rewarding, emotions can be
unusual, strong, or unusually associated. What the interviews show is that, in the first place, players are usually
attracted to games where the aesthetic aspect is a success. However this aspect is only interesting for a short
time: as soon as performance starts to become a central aspect of gameplay, what turns out to be important is
the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s ability to generate emotions on a regular basis, and to be used as a benchmark to evaluate and
compare progress. Depending on the players implication, his/her interest switches from aesthetic realism to the
search for a game adapted, or adaptable, to the task. During Lan-Parties, experienced players parameterised
Quake, not to get the best possible realism but to obtain the maximum speed, precision and clarity. Then the
surroundings have to display a certain form of coherence in driving feelings related to the challenges that are at
stake},

abstract = {The GMABS (Games and Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) methodology was created from the integration of RPG and MABS techniques. This methodology links the dynamic capacity of MABS (Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) and the discussion and learning capacity of RPG (Role-Playing Games). Using GMABS, we have developed two prototypes in the natural resources management domain. The first prototype, called JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2005), is a paper-based game: all players need to be physically present in the same place and time, and there is a minimum needed number of participants to play the game. In order to avoid this constraint, we have built a second prototype, called ViP-JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2007), which is an extension of the first one. This second game enables the insertion of virtual players that can substitute some real players in the game. These virtual players can partially mime real behaviors and capture autonomy, social abilities, reaction and adaptation of the real players. We have chosen the BDI architecture to model these virtual players, since its paradigm is based on folk psychology; hence, its core concepts easily map the language that people use to describe their reasoning and actions in everyday life. ViP-JogoMan is a computer-based game, in which people play via Web, players can be in different places and it does not have a hard constraint regarding the minimum number of real players. Our aim in this paper is to present some test results obtained with both prototypes, as well as to present a preliminary discussion on how the insertion of virtual players has affected the game results.},

abstract = {This research paper reports a case study of two male photosensitive epileptic patients, aged 14 and 16 years old respectively, whose epileptic seizures were often triggered by the flickers from television and video games respectively. The 14-year old patient had no family history of epilepsy, while the 16 year old had a family history of epilepsy. A comprehensive electroencephalogram (EEG), including hyperventilation, intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) and pattern stimulation were carried out on them and EEG abnormalities including photoparoxysmal responses (PPR) and generalized myoclonic responses were evoked. A thorough analysis of the EEG morphology of the myclonic responses and the clinical manifestations showed evidence of two separate entitles of seizures namely: visually evoked pattern-myoclonic responses (PTMR) and visually evoked photomyoclonic responses (PMR). PTMR was independent of flash rate and occurred before a PPR and at the same time as the flash rate, while PMR occurred after the PPR and was dependent on flash rate. These findings suggest that \&quot;Video Game\&quot; epilepsy is probably a pattern sensitive epilepsy, electronic screen being the source of the triggering patterns; hence, the morphology and the family histories and the myoclonic phenomena differ from those of pure photosensitive epilepsy.

abstract = {A haptic device based on an electrorheological fluid has been designed and tested. The device is similar to a joystick which controls the motion of a cursor on a computer screen. In electric fields of different strength the shear stress of the electrorheological fluid is increased accordingly, which is perceived by the user by different resistance forces against the motion of the joystick. Controlled by the software the user can feel if the cursor enters a selected field on the screen. Such haptic devices can be useful in various possible applications like supporting tools for the operation of machines, assisting interfaces for blind persons working with a computer, virtual reality or computer games. The design of the haptic device, its components and the electrorheological fluid used are described.},

@article{ReeleyJr2007,
abstract = {This essay explores the controversial hypothesis of reciprocal determinism, a subset of the Social Cognitive Theory developed by Albert Bandura, Ph.D. The hypothesis suggests that external forces likely influence the behavior of an individual, and in turn, the individual reshapes (reciprocally) society in an escalading cycle of manipulation and modification. Diverse perspectives are gathered from seminal books and peer-reviewed journals in an attempt to substantiate or conceivably refute the notion that mass media, the Internet, video games, and other forms of one-way and interactive technology may be stirring aggressive behavior (by way of modeling), as well as desensitizing children and adolescents to real violence that occurs in everyday life. While some developmental theorists claimed that measurable modifications in human behavior are brought about by internal (biological) or external (societal) forces that are equally perpetual and inescapable, others argued that recipes of both cognitive and innate factors comprise the essential ingredients that shape the ego, define the personality, or influence reflective choices individuals will make throughout their lifetime. Because theories are devised to seek explanations for the seemingly inexplicable, theorists continue to proffer formidable arguments in support of their unique research. While this essay threads together selected past and ongoing literature about a disquieting social phenomenon, the intent was not to produce new evidence on the matter, except that predicting outcomes of human behavior continues to evade scientific certainty.},

@article{Goldin2004,
abstract = {Message filtering is important for distributed multiagent systems, where a large number of dynamic agents participate in the system activity, but a typical agent is interested in only a very small dynamic subset of the other agents. The agent must be constantly informed on the status of this subset, and this is achieved by message passing between relevant agents. Message filtering is required to reduce the communications load on the system, which could be prohibitive if each agent must communicate with all others in order to obtain the information it needs. This paper deals with the case of a multiagent virtual environment, where each agent has a location in 2D space, and is interested in a small subset of the other agents, either those within a fixed range-as treated by previous authors, or the k other agents nearest to it-treated here for the first time. Furthermore, we treat the case of a fully distributed system, where no central server(s) are available to coordinate between the agents. The main challenge is then to design protocols that perform significant message filtering, yet enable each agent to maintain a consistent image of the other agents it is interested in. These protocols are useful in multiagent games, simulations, and other virtual environments in which the geometric relationships between agents are important. They could also be useful for mobile-commerce and cellphone-based gaming applications.},

To find out whether this could be true and to understand what the specific approaches could entail for educational games, three separate yet related investigations were conducted to examine single- versus multiplayer games: an investigation of two educational games designed and evaluated by the authors, a theoretical investigation from a game and learning perspective, and an empirical investigation of 23 case studies. From these three investigations, it turned out that a \{$\backslash$quotesinglbase\}\{\"{A}\}\{\'{u}\}single-player approach\{$\backslash$quotesinglbase\}\{\"{A}\}\{\`{u}\} is data intensive, has formal rules, and uses direct transfer and individual learning. On the other hand, a \{$\backslash$quotesinglbase\}\{\"{A}\}\{\'{u}\}multiplayer approach\{$\backslash$quotesinglbase\}\{\"{A}\}\{\`{u}\} is less straightforward. From a game perspective, it can be characterized as process intensive and having social rules. When related to learning, however, it could be positioned on any dimension. This exploration shows that the approaches differ to a large extent and that designers have to find a fit between what option they choose and approach they take.},

Using a comparative analysis, the author shows that the two games' have different approaches to using characters as narrative tools within the same genre, while also incorporating these narrative features tightly into gameplay. Central to the argument is the idea that presenting the player as protagonist is not necessarily the most fruitful approach to narrative experiences in games, and that narrative coherence may be better established and maintained through letting non-player characters carry the weight of narrative progression.},

abstract = {Objective: To test the effects of media violence exposure on blood pressure, negative affect, hostile social information processing, uncooperative behavior, and attitudes toward health risk behaviors among young men varying in lifetime violence exposure within the home and community. Design: Experimental laboratory study. Setting: University campus situated within an urban environment. Participants: One hundred male undergraduates aged 18 to 21 years. Intervention: Men who had previously reported differing amounts of lifetime home and community violence were randomly assigned to play The Simpsons: Hit and Run (low-violence condition) or Grand Theft Auto III (high-violence condition). Main Outcome Measures: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure; negative affect; hostile social information processing; uncooperative behavior; and permissive attitudes toward violence, alcohol use, marijuana use, and sexual activity without condom use. Results: Men randomly assigned to play Grand Theft Auto III exhibited greater increases in diastolic blood pressure from a baseline rest period to game play, greater negative affect, more permissive attitudes toward using alcohol and marijuana, and more uncooperative behavior in comparison with men randomly assigned to play The Simpsons. Only among participants with greater exposure to home and community violence, play of Grand Theft Auto III led to elevated systolic blood pressure in comparison with play of The Simpsons (mean, 13 vs 5 mm Hg). Conclusions: Media violence exposure may play a role in the development of negative attitudes and behaviors related to health. Although youth growing up in violent homes and communities may become more physiologically aroused by media violence exposure, all youth appear to be at risk for potentially negative outcomes.},

In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for rep- resenting trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists. In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players. We demon- strate this by performing a close reading of one recent and much-discussed game, The Walking Dead: Season One, analyzing how it incorporates psychological trauma in terms of inter(re)activity, empathy, and complicity.},

It argues that Bioshock not only uses the techniques of traditional narrative forms to address the culturally significant issue of the impossible alliance between traditionalism and libertarianism under a conservative banner but also uses the interactive medium to generate a genuinely new aesthetic experience in which the logic of free choice in the narrative, ideology, and medium are simultaneously brought into juxtaposition.

abstract = {We find ourselves in a media-intensive milieu comprising networks, images, sounds, and text, which we generalize as data and metadata. How can we understand this digital milieu and make sense of these data, not only focusing on their functionalities but also reflecting on our everyday life and existence? How do these material constructions demand a new philosophical understand- ing? Instead of following the reductionist approaches, which understand the digital milieu as abstract entities such as information and data, this article pro- poses to approach it from an embodied perspective: objects. The article contrasts digital objects with natural objects (e.g., apples on the table) and technical objects (e.g., hammers) in phenomenological investigations, and proposes to approach digital objects from the concept of “relations,” on the one hand the material relations that are concretized in the development of mark-up languages, such as SGML, HTML, and XML, and on the other hand, Web ontologies, the temporal relations that are produced and conditioned by the artificial memories of data.},

abstract = {In this article, the authors reflect on the question why simulation games are such an effective tool for learning. The article is based on the authors\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} experience and that of many other practitioners in the field. The article posits that it is the confluence of systemic knowledge, practice, emotional involvement, and social embeddedness that creates the potential to achieve results that no other methods can match. A simulation game run constitutes a bout of individual and collective purposeful action by an individual or a group formed specifically for that purpose. People have evolved to be supremely good at just that. Simulation games can teach systemic knowledge, and they can enable participants to try out organizational changes. This potential is not always realized, however. Game runs are \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}alive\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} and variable, and this is a risky strength. They activate not only the explicit rules but also the hidden cultural rules of the participants. This can lead to memorable learning as well as to frustration, particularly when games are used across cultures. The article specifies reasons why games could fail and offers ways to avoid these pitfalls. It shows that experience and craftsmanship are needed in game design, facilitation, and debriefing. },

abstract = {Player immersion is the holy grail of computer game designers particularly in environments such as those found in first-person shooters. However, little is understood about the processes of immersion and much is assumed. This is certainly the case with sound and its immersive potential. Some theoretical work explores this sonic relationship but little experimental data exist to either confirm or invalidate existing theories and assumptions.

This paper summarizes and reports on the results of a preliminary psychophysiological experiment to measure human arousal and valence in the context of sound and immersion in first-person shooter computer games. It is conducted in the context of a larger set of psychophysiological investigations assessing the nature of the player experience and is the first in a series of systematic experiments investigating the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s relationship to sound in the genre. In addition to answering questionnaires, participants were required to play a bespoke Half-Life 2 level whilst being measured with electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electromyography, galvanic skin response and eye tracking equipment. We hypothesize that subjective responses correlated with objective measurements provide a more accurate assessment of the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physical arousal and emotional valence and that changes in these factors may be mapped to subjective states of immersion in first-person shooter computer games.},

The model includes three components: sensory, challenge-based and imaginative immersion (SCI-model). The classification was assessed with self-evaluation questionnaires filled in by informants who played different popular games.

Studies show that adults\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} comments before or during media exposure can reduce the impact of violent programming on children aggressiveness under some circumstances. Experiments involving more extensive media literacy curricula show that some approaches can alter attitudes toward media violence and, in a few cases, intervene in aggressive behavior. Studies of the impact of antiviolence media productions reveal that although such efforts can be effective, unanticipated "boomerang" effects are prevalent. Overall, the effectiveness of the 3 types of interventions was highly variable, and age and gender differences were prominent. The findings suggest that more research is needed to determine the best approaches to developing parental interventions, media literacy strategies, and prosocial media presentations for reducing youth violence.},

abstract = {In this paper I explore some aspects of the rise of early business games in the post-war period after the Second World War. For a game to become truth-apt in a scientific sense and able to guide actions in a pragmatic sense it needs coupling to the computer and its technical-mechanical calculatory competence as well as certain types of rationality assigned to it culturally. Regarding this interconnection of games and rationality with the medium computer, three different ways of using computers can be described: First, the idea of the computer functions operationally in administration. With the aid of the computer, many of the corporate management’s tasks are to be realized in a more rational and less mistake prone way. Secondly, the computer appears simulatorily in this context, by calculating and presenting complex management operations. Following the idea of the cybernetic control circuit the computer as dream constellation promises understanding and manipulability of complex systemic interdependencies. Third, the constellation of the computer acts as a stochastic and probabilistic tool, as a decision making aid in possible situations and for the consequences of future decisions. In early business simulations the company, modeled as a game, is examined and evaluated with the aid of the computer. Thus the business game serves as a metareflection of processes, decisions, strategies and planning within the company (1). The interconnections of rationality and the mediality of computing machines are complex and run parallelly on several levels, as historically the computer not only changes the functionality of a business operationally as an element of rationalization in order to increase efficiency for example in administrative procedures (scientific management), but at the same time is also used on the level of longterm planning, analysis, decision making as well as in schooling and training (decision making).},

They believe that the detection of and adaptation to student cognition and affect may boost student learning gains and enhance the quality of students\{$\backslash$quotesinglbase\}\{\"{A}\}\{\^{o}\} overall learning experience. A growing body of research focuses specifically on the study of cognitive-affective dynamics, defined as the natural ways in which a student\{$\backslash$quotesinglbase\}\{\"{A}\}\{\^{o}\}s cognitive-affective states change over time. These types of studies help designers identify desirable (virtuous) cycles that they want to foster and undesirable (vicious) cycles that they want to dissuade. In this study, the author examined the dynamics of the cognitive-affective states exhibited by Filipino students as they used the pre-algebra game MATH BLASTER 9-12. The author focused on the cognitive-affective states of boredom, confusion, delight, engagement, frustration, neutrality, and surprise. Using quantitative field observations, the author determined which of these states tended to persist or transition into other states over time. It was found that boredom was the only state that tended to persist. Boredom tended not to lead to engagement. Students who were confused were not likely to stay confused but were likely to transition into engagement. Students who were delighted were not likely to become confused. From these findings and based on comparisons with related work, it is concluded that boredom is a persistent and undesirable state. Confusion is not persistent and is desirable because it leads to further engagement with the content.},

The simulation environment without collision detection was divided into two sections, a uniform velocity section and a variable velocity section. The Euler method was shown to have the best fps in the simulation environment with collision detection.

abstract = {Cognitive science provides a useful approach to studying computer gameplay, especially from the perspective of determining the cognitive skills that players learn during play. Computer games are highly visual medium and game interaction involves continuous visual cognition. A system integrating an eyetracker with a 3D computer game engine has been developed to provide real time gaze object logging, a fast and convenient way of collecting gaze object data for analysis. This system has been used to test three hypotheses concerning visual attention in close combat tactics as simulated by a first-person shooter (FPS) computer game. Firstly, the cuing effect of the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s gun graphic on visual attention was tested, but no evidence was found to support this. Data supported the second hypothesis, that a player attends to the target opponent while shooting at them, in most cases, while in a small percentage of cases this is achieved in peripheral vision. Finally, in most cases, a player targets the nearest opponent. These results provide a baseline for further investigations in which the stimulus game design may be modified to provide more detailed models of the visual cognitive processes involved in gameplay. These models document the learning outcomes of game interaction and provide a basis for improvements, such as the optimization of combat survival tactics.},

Next, participants watched a 10-min videotape containing scenes of real-life violence while heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were monitored. Participants who previously played a violent video game had lower HR and GSR while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological desensitization to violence.

Photosensitivity has an important genetic component. Some patients are sensitive to patterns, suggesting an occipital trigger for these events. Myoclonus and generalised convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures may be triggered by visual stimuli. Partial seizures occur less often and can be confused with migraine. Although usually idiopathic, photosensitive epilepsy may occur in degenerative diseases and some patients with photosensitive partial seizures have brain lesions. Sunlight and video screens, including television, video games, and computer displays, are the commonest environmental triggers of photosensitive seizures. Outbreaks of triggered seizures have occurred when certain flashing or patterned images have been broadcast. There are regulations to prevent this in some countries only. Pure photosensitive epilepsy has a good prognosis. There is a role for treatment with and without antiepileptic drugs, but photosensitivity usually does not disappear spontaneously, and then typically in the third decade.},

What can researchers learn from the elevation of the history of science to an established discipline and profession that might help scholars understand the situation of game studies? And why are game studies today being talked about in ways similar to the rhetoric that accompanied the history of science in the 1960s and 1970s? The author suggests that the growth of history of science then and game studies now has been fueled by similar motivations and strategies. These reflections on the history of science suggest there is nothing about such divisions that dooms or even threatens the growth and eventual success of this new discipline.},

abstract = {In computer and video games, the player resides at the interface of viewer and actor. This position makes possible the player's creative participation in these interactive media, a contribution that cannot be described in terms of the traditional roles of creator or consumer. The player is more than a consumer of what game developers and designers have created, and more than a reader or viewer. A game designer \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}creates a context to be encountered by a participant, from which meaning emerges\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} (Salen and Zimmerman 41). In the last decade or so, game players have used computer games as platforms for creating their own games, narratives, texts, and performances. They have reshaped the context of computer play, not simply by creating personal artifacts equivalent to a home movie, doodle, or diary, but by fully exploiting games as a new medium for performance and artistic expression. These efforts on occasion have challenged storytelling technologies such as frame-based animation, and have entered the mainstream through music videos, web-based serial programming, and other popular formats. The performer has pushed forward into the spotlight of game culture. So, how might game studies reveal players as performers? Learning more about the meanings players attach to play gestures, studying high-level competitive play, understanding what it means to watch others as they play, examining more closely the significance of replays and game movies in game culture, describing the formation of player identities, documenting in-game social dynamics, and tracing the networked virtual communities that thrive around computer games are but a few of many topics that might contribute to better understanding of game performance. This article presents a few ideas about players' active participation in game culture through one mode of visible public performance: machinima and related game movies.

abstract = {Simulation has been used traditionally to solve other areas problems. Real time applications like videogames use typically a scheme of coupling of simulation phase and rendering phase and they uses a continuous simulation model. That way of operation is inefficient and may produce erroneous simulations. Using a discrete event simulation paradigm, those problems can be avoided. That paradigm can be achieved using a discrete event simulator as a videogame kernel. This paper proposes the integration of a discrete event simulator into real time applications to control the applications simulation. The use of a discrete methodology avoids disorderly events execution or the execution of cancelled events. This implies to use events in order to model the system dynamics, the objects interaction and the objects behavior. GDESK is a discrete event simulator prepared to be used as a videogame kernel. It is the adaptation of DESK (discrete event simulation kernel) to videogames kernel. GDESK allows the complete system to work using discrete events. The videogame is a set of objects interchanging events. The events are managed by the GDESK dispatcher. It executes the events ordered in time. The GDESK integration into a videogame produces the change of the videogame simulation paradigm. That produces a more accurate simulation and saves computing power due to the saves of unnecessary renderings.},

abstract = {Purpose: Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in school-age children and adolescents. For example, by reading a variety of books, magazines, and newspapers, students gain exposure to complex vocabulary, and reading becomes a prime opportunity for learning new words. Despite the importance of reading for lexical development, little is known about the pleasure reading habits of today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s youth. The first goal of this investigation was to examine the preferences of older children and young adolescents with respect to reading as a leisure-time activity and its relationship to other free-time options that are likely to compete for their attention. The second goal was to examine the amount of time that young people spend reading for pleasure each day and the types of materials they most enjoy reading. The third goal was to determine if preferences for free-time activities and reading materials would evince age- and gender-related differences during the period of development from late childhood through early adolescence (ages 11-15 years). The findings could serve as a reference point for understanding what is reasonable to expect of students during this age range. Method: The participants were too sixth graders (mean age = 11;7 [years;months]) and 100 ninth graders (mean age 14;8) attending public schools in western Oregon. Each group contained an equal number of boys and girls, all of whom spoke English as their primary language and were considered to be typical achievers. All participants completed a survey concerning their preferred free-time activities and reading materials. They also reported the average amount of time they spent reading for pleasure each day. 3,000 words per year (Nagy \& Scott, 2000; White, Power, \& White, 1989), resulting in a working knowledge of at least 40,000 different words by the senior year of high school (Nagy \& Herman, 1987). One factor promoting this. Results: The most popular free-time activities were listening to music/going to concerts, watching television or videos, playing sports, and playing computer or video games. Least preferred activities were cooking, running or walking, writing, and arts and crafts. Reading was moderately popular. The most popular reading materials were magazines, novels, and comics; least popular were plays, technical books, and newspapers. Interest in pleasure reading declined during this age range (11-15 years), and boys were more likely than girls to report that they spent no time reading for pleasure. Clinical Implications: Given the importance of reading to lexical development in school-age children and adolescents, reading should be promoted as a leisure activity during these years. School-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs), in their role as language consultants, can benefit from understanding the pleasure-reading patterns of today\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s youth. It is especially important for SLPs to monitor these patterns in students who have language disorders, as it is common for these young people to experience deficits in reading and in lexical development. Fortunately, much can be done in school settings to encourage strong literacy habits in all students if SLPs work collaboratively with teachers, principals, psychologists, librarians, parents, and students. Suggestions are offered for ways to encourage young people to spend more time reading for pleasure.},

abstract = {The implementation of a computer game for learning about geography by primary school students is the focus of this article. Researchers designed and developed a three-dimensional educational computer game. Twenty four students in fourth and fifth grades in a private school in Ankara, Turkey learnt about world continents and countries through this game for three weeks. The effects of the game environment on students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} achievement and motivation and related implementation issues were examined through both quantitative and qualitative methods. An analysis of pre and post achievement tests showed that students made significant learning gains by participating in the game-based learning environment. When comparing their motivations while learning in the game-based learning environment and in their traditional school environment, it was found that students demonstrated statistically significant higher intrinsic motivations and statistically significant lower extrinsic motivations learning in the game-based environment. In addition, they had decreased focus on getting grades and they were more independent while participating in the game-based activities. These positive effects on learning and motivation, and the positive attitudes of students and teachers suggest that computer games can be used as an ICT tool in formal learning environments to support students in effective geography learning.},

Specifically, this paper presents the major findings of a questionnaire based survey distributed to undergraduate students at Sheffield\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s two universities, and a number of follow up interviews. Contrary to popular perceptions, this research finds no evidence to suggest that participating in digital gaming can have a negative effect on levels of sports participation. Moreover, the paper argues that, for some, digital gaming may increase their interest and knowledge of sport, and can prove for many a popular source of conversation that can cross-cut and inform conversations on sport. However, contrary to many previous studies, this research indicates that there continues to be distinct gender differences in gaming patterns.},

abstract = {This article explores relationships between players and the owners of the massively multiplayer online games (MMOG) they inhabit. Much of the language around these large scale communities currently focuses on “management.” Viewing these complex social systems as essentially mechanical in nature has led to a preoccupation with creating or retrofitting systems which can be constantly monitored, tuned, regulated, and controlled. Though the language often turns to things like “cheating,” “griefing,” and “disruption of the magic circle,” the underlying anxiety about unruliness, transgressiveness, and the emergent nature of these spaces as sites of culture needs to be more fully addressed, as well as the early formulations of the “imagined player” that shape the design process. Players are central productive agents in game culture and more progressive models are needed for understanding and integrating their work in these spaces. Drawing on the long tradition of participatory design this piece explores some alternative frameworks for understanding the designer/player relationship are proposed.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that exposure to media violence increases aggression, though the mechanisms of this effect have remained elusive. One theory posits that repeated exposure to media violence desensitizes viewers to real world violence, increasing aggression by blunting aversive reactions to violence and removing normal inhibitions against aggression. Theoretically, violence desensitization should be reflected in the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), which has been associated with activation of the aversive motivational system. In the current study, violent images elicited reduced P300 amplitudes among violent, as compared to nonviolent video game players. Additionally, this reduced brain response predicted increased aggressive behavior in a later task. Moreover, these effects held after controlling for individual differences in trait aggressiveness. These data are the first to link media violence exposure and aggressive behavior to brain processes hypothetically associated with desensitization. },

For those trials with the Distractor, a segment of the television show "The Simpsons" was simultaneously played on a television screen adjacent to the computer game monitor and at an equal volume. Contrary to theory and expectations an analysis of the data did not reveal any statistically significant differences in the frequency, type and severity of body movements between the ADHD and non-ADHD boys, or between the ADHD subtypes during computer video game play.

Efforts to exclude race (and intersections with gender, nation, and sexuality) from public discussions through its erasure and the acceptance of larger discourses of colorblindness contribute to a problematic understanding of video games and their significant role in contemporary social, political, economic, and cultural organization. How can one truly understand fantasy, violence, gender roles, plot, narrative, game playability, virtual realities, and the like without examining race, racism, and/or racial stratification--one cannot.

The ludology/narratology debate exhibits two important features: anxiety about the proximity of the discipline to the games industry, and a formalist bias that dominates the field. Focussing on race and alignment in role playing games, this paper addresses this bias by asserting the relevance of cultural materialist and postcolonial modes of critique to commercially-produced computer games. It is argued that games like Baldur\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s Gate I and II cannot be properly understood without reference to the fantasy novels that inform them. When historicised, the genre of fantasy reveals an implicit reliance on notions of race and moral alignment. The ways these notions re-appear in digital role playing games is shown to be relevant to current political and social realities of the West.},

Two hundred forty-nine introductory psychology students read either EVCB or NVCB. After reading the comic books, participants read hypothetical stories in which overt or relational aggression occurred but the intent of the provocateur was ambiguous. After each story participants were asked a series of questions about the provocateur\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s intent, potential retaliation toward the provocateur, and the provocateur\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s emotional state. Trait hostility was significantly related to hostile responding. Regardless of the type of aggression, participants reading EVCB responded more negatively than participants reading NVCB did. Males responded more negatively to the overt scenarios, whereas females responded more negatively to the relational scenarios. Results indicate that interpretation of ambiguous material appears to be affected by a number of variables, including gender, trait hostility, and violent media.},

In this study, we investigated hemodynamic changes in the dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC) (luring video games as one of daily amusements, using near infrared spectroscopy technique. It was previously reported that oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) in adults\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} DPFC decreased during prolonged game playing time. In the present study, we examined whether similar changes were observed in children. Twenty children (7-14 years old) participated in our study, but only 13 of them were eventually subject to analysis. They played one or two commercially available video games; namely a fighting and a puzzle game, for 5 min. We used changes in concentration of oxyHb as an indicator of brain activity and consequently, most of the children exhibited a sustained game-related oxyHb decrease in DPFC. Decrease patterns of oxyHb in children during video game playing time did not differ from those in adults. There was no significant correlation between ages or game performances and changes in oxyHb. These findings suggest that game-related oxyHb decrease in DPFC is a common phenomenon to adults and children at least older than 7 years old, and we suggest that this probably results from attention demand from the video games rather than from subject\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s age and performance.},

The general working questions are whether art displays any charac- teristic traits that are common for all modelling systems and which could be the specific traits that can distinguish art from other modelling systems. Art is seen as a secondary modelling system, more precisely, as a play-type model, which is characterised simultaneously by practical and conventional behaviour and cons- tant awareness of the possibility of alternate meanings to the one that is currently being perceived. At the same time art has play-like elements but is not the same as play, since play is inherently rule-bound, whereas art is a more flexible model the purpose of which is truth. Art is a special type of modelling system, since it is on one hand suitable for storing very large amount of complex information, but on the other hand it can increase the stored information and transform the consumer.},

abstract = {The now-famous equation, "knowledge is power" ("scientia potestas est"), was coined by Francis Bacon in 1597. Since then it has been rephrased in a wide variety of contexts from Thomas Hobbes to Michel Foucault. In recent years, this elusive topos has in fact proved essential to the poststructuralist critique of the humanist subject. Acknowledging the im- possibility of doing justice, in this essay, to the complexities of Bacon's and the poststructuralists' respective articulations of knowledge and power, I will focus primarily on a selection of significant aphorisms that encapsulate Bacon's main ideas on science and the state. In the second half of the essay I also assess Michel Foucault's immensely influential "knowledge/power" ("pouvoir/savoir") binomial. Both Bacon's and Foucault's ideas will be filtered through Pierre Bourdieu's restatement of hierarchically organized structures of knowledge and power. In the last few pages I bring into my discussion Foucault's later writings on ethics and disciplinarity - the so-called "final Foucault" or "1980s Foucault" - which allow the self both a greater degree of freedom and larger room for maneuver in organizing its resistance to the coercion of dominant powers. Whereas Foucault moves from his earlier suspicion of public forms of learning and their attending institutions (e.g., existing hierarchies, discursive conventions) to an instrumental appropriation by the self of that learning for the purposes of self-cultivation, both Bacon and Bourdieu seem to agree that power and knowledge are most clearly seen in the creation and self-reproduction of a professional class of experts in science and communication whose main interest is to keep control over official institutions of learning.},

Fuzzeval, our proposed mechanism, consists of a fuzzy controller that dynamically evaluates the perceived strength of the board configurations it receives. Fuzzeval employs an evaluation function that adjusts the membership functions linked to the linguistic variables employed in the knowledge base. The membership functions are aligned to the average crisp input that was successfully used in the past winning games. Fuzzeval mechanisms are adaptive and have the simplicity associated with fuzzy controllers. Our experiments show that Fuzzeval improves its performance up to 42\% after a match of only one hundred backgammon games played against Pubeval, a strong intermediate level program.},

Research using computer games in contextual interference studies has yielded a large effect (f = .50) with a random practice schedule advantage during transfer. These investigations had a total of 36 and 72 acquisition trials, respectively. The present study tested this prediction by having 72 college students, who were randomly assigned to a blocked or random practice schedule, practice 102 trials of three computer-game tasks across three days. After a 24-hr. interval, 6 retention and 5 transfer trials were performed. Dependent variables were time to complete an event in seconds and number of errors. No significant differences were found for retention and transfer.

Metagame programs take the rules of a randomly generated game as input, then do some analysis of that game, and then play the game against an opponent. Success in Metagame competitions is evidence of a more general kind of ability than that possessed by (for example) a chess program or a draughts program. In this paper, we take up one of Pell\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s challenges by building a Metagame player that can learn. The learning techniques used are a refinement of the regression methods of Christensen and Korf, and they are applied to unsupervised learning, from self-play, of the weights of the components (or advisors) of the evaluation function. The method used leads to significant improvement in playing strength for many (but not all) games in the class. We also shed light on some curious behaviour of some advisor weights.

Brands demonstrated recall superiority when they were a major part of game-play or when they were local or new brands, atypical of brands found in games, or relevant to the consumer.

Set direction and acting are limited by tools that were designed to create and play video games rather than produce expressive performance pieces. These tools do a poor job of capturing the performative expression that characterizes more mature media such as film. Tangible interfaces can help open up the game systems for more intuitive character control needed for a greater level of expression in the digital real-time world. The TUI3D project (Tangible User Interfaces for Real-Time 3D) addresses production and performative challenges involved in creating machinima through the development of tangible interfaces for controlling 3D virtual actors and environments in real-time.

abstract = {Research studying the effects of playing videogames has largely focused on their negative effects on aggressive attitudes and behaviours. The potential positive effects have received less theoretical and empirical attention. The present study used flow theory to permit a wider examination of the potential consequences of gaming for measures of affect and psychological well-being. Furthermore, it aimed to show how aggressive personality was linked to the gaming experience and whether this was associated with consequences for mood and psychological well-being. An experimental design was used, in which videogamers were recruited to play one of two videogames. Pre-test measures of trait aggression; psychological well-being and affect were taken. Following a forty minute game-play period, post-test measures on affect and flow were completed. Preliminary analyses of the pre and post-test measures of affect, revealed evidence to suggest that gaming can facilitate positive mood. Trait aggression showed to be negatively related to dimensions of psychological well-being but was not correlated with violent game content or flow in gaming. This suggests engagement with gaming to be a product of much more than violent content and that aggressive personality is not inherently linked to enjoyment of games with such content. Further research, however, is needed to confirm the importance of violent content and aggressive personality in predicting the social and psychological outcomes of gaming. },

Residents trained in the Procedicus Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) laparoscopic simulator perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy safer and faster than a control group. Little has been reported regarding whether factors like gender, computer experience, and visuospatial tests can predict the performance with a medical simulator. Our aim was to investigate whether such factors influence the performance of simulated gastroscopy. Seventeen medical students were asked about computer gaming experiences. Before virtual endoscopy, they performed the visuospatial test PicCOr, which discriminates the ability of the tested person to create a three-dimensional image from a two-dimensional presentation. Each student performed one gastroscopy (level 1, case 1) in the GI Mentor II, Simbionix, and several variables related to performance were registered. Percentage of time spent with a clear view in the endoscope correlated well with the performance on the PicSOr test (r = 0.56, P < 0.001). Efficiency of screening also correlated with PicSOr (r = 0.23, P < 0.05). In students with computer gaming experience, the efficiency of screening increased (33.6\% +/- 3.1\% versus 22.6\% +/- 2.8\%, P < 0.05) and the duration of the examination decreased by 1.5 minutes (P < 0.05). A similar trend was seen in men compared with women. The visuospatial test PicSOr predicts the results with the endoscopic simulator GI Mentor II. Two-dimensional image experience, as in computer games, also seems to affect the outcome.},

abstract = {Researchers interested in the associations of gender with spatial experience and spatial ability have not yet focused on several activities that have become common in the modern digital age. In this study, using a new questionnaire called the Survey of Spatial Representation and Activities (SSRA), we examined spatial experiences with computers and videogames in a sample of nearly 1,300 undergraduate students. Large gender differences, which favored men, were found in computer experience. Although men and women also differed on SAT scores, gender differences in computer experience were still apparent with SAT factored out. Furthermore, men and women with high and low levels of computer experience, who were selected for more intensive study, were found to differ significantly on the Mental Rotations Test (MRT). Path analyses showed that computer experience substantially mediates the gender difference in spatial ability observed on the MRT. These results collectively suggest that the "Digital Divide" is an important phenomenon and that encouraging women and girls to gain spatial experiences, such as computer usage, might help to bridge the gap in spatial ability between the sexes.},

Role- playing language is different from everyday language, because the worlds created in role-play are not just a reflection or extension of everyday life. We examine three examples of interaction in live action role- playing games. In all three, players rely on shared cultural knowledge. In the first example, two players employ the cultural conventions about the meanings of colors, objects and space as well as materials borrowed from myth and folklore in order to enact an encounter between a mage and a dragon. In the second, the organizers enact scenes from literary classics in order to construct the game plot. In the third, the players employ cultural stereotypes of personalities and behavior in order to present characters of diverse age and social status. Angelina},

Results suggest that games and simulations improve a variety of cognitive capabilities. Furthermore, there is evidence for positive transfer from activities required by games and simulations to real world task performance. This transfer appears to depend much more on similarities between cognitive and attention processes than on physical similarities. Attitudes to games were found to be positive. However, the findings suggest that hostility and aggression tend to increase as a result of exposure to games, and school grades may suffer as a result of excessive game playing. Recommendations for the development of games, limits to the generality of findings, concerns about research on games, and recommendations for further research are discussed.},

Dependent variables include identification, presence, emotional experiences and motivations. When story was present, game players felt greater identification, sense of presence, and physiological arousal. The presence of story did not affect self-reported arousal or dominance. This study clearly demonstrates that story is something that video game players enjoy; it helps involve them in the game play, makes them feel more immersed in the virtual environment, and keeps them aroused. The greater character identification may be especially worrisome, as past research has shown that justified media violence disinhibits actual aggression on the part of the audience.},

abstract = {Purpose. To examine sedentary behaviours (including television viewing, playing computer games and computer use), diet, exercise and fitness in relation to overweight/obesity in Australian adolescents. Methods. Questionnaires elicited food frequency data, time spent in TV viewing, using computers, other sedentary occupations and physical activity recall. Weight, height and fitness (laps completed in the Leger test) were measured. Results. Among 281 boys and 321 girls, mean age 12 years (SD 0.9), 56 boys (20.0\%) and 70 girls (23.3\%) were overweight/obese. Greater fitness was associated with decreased risk of overweight/obesity in boys (Odds ratio [OR] 0.74; 95\% CI 0.55, 0.99) and girls (OR 0.93; 95\% CI 0.91, 0.99). TV-viewing predicted increased risk in boys (OR 1.04; 95\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}\% CI 1.01, 1.06) and decreased risk in girls (OR 0.99; 95\% CI 0.96, 0.99). Computer use, video games, and other sedentary behaviours were not significantly related to risk of overweight/obesity. Vegetable intake was associated with lower risk in boys (OR 0.98; 95\% CI 0.97, 0.99); greater risk was associated with lower fat intake in boys and girls, lower consumption of energy-dense snacks in boys (OR 0.74; 95\% CI 0.62, 0.88) and greater intake of vegetables in girls (OR 1.02; 95\% CI 1.00, 1.03), suggesting dieting or knowledge of favourable dietary choices in overweight/obese children. Conclusions. Among these adolescents, fitness was negatively related to risk for overweight/obesity in boys and girls. TV-viewing was a positive predictor in boys and a negative predictor in girls but the effect size was small; other sedentary behaviours did not predict risk.},

Video games provide a diverse set of experiences and related activities and are part of the lives of almost all teens in America. To date, most video game research has focused on how games impact academic and social outcomes (particularly aggression). There has also been some exploration of the relationship between games and civic outcomes, but as of yet there has been no large-scale quantitative research. This survey provides the first nationally representative study of teen video game play and of teen video gaming and civic engagement. The survey looks at which teens are playing games, the games and equipment they are using, the social context of their play, and the role of parents and parental monitoring. Though arguments have been made about the civic potential of video gaming, this is the first large-scale study to examine the relationship between specific gaming experiences and teens\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} civic activities and commitments.},

This target is only slightly short of being reached, as was demonstrated when Columbia Pictures released Final Fantasy in 2001, an animated science fiction film with high-definition emotive characters. Through what has been a cultural and technological convergence, we are now starting to see software tools and techniques that can generate life-like characters while not sacrificing the human judgement and artistic skills that are needed in character animation. Computer games, films, and the Internet are now starting to use virtual humans, which as our conclusion will show will become more realistic. However, a new challenge has been set - people now do not want to just play a computer game with a visually realistic character, or see a television programme with a vivid computer generated character - they want to see themselves in that computer game or film. The future is towards individuals having their own virtual clones, which they can utilise in computer-generated worlds and applications. This paper will discuss the advantages of having a personal computer-generated character, and also describe several systems that BTexact Technologies have successfully developed and deployed to generate them, as well as some of the applications for which they can be used. The paper will finish by glimpsing into the future of what we can expect to see in the next few years, with the advent of this new exciting technology.},

Nor were framing and order effects lower among participants reporting familiarity with the trolley problem or with loss-aversion framing effects, nor among those reporting hav- ing had a stable opinion on the issues before participating the experiment, nor among those reporting expertise on the very issues in question.

abstract = {Purpose \{$\backslash$textendash\} The purpose of this paper is to identify, characterize, and discuss paradigm shifts that have occurred in the video game industry with some emphasis on competition and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach \{$\backslash$textendash\} Basically, the paper depends upon a review of the literature associated with video game development. Past history is taken from texts and academic papers dealing with the subject. More current observations are taken from the business and popular press. These observations are placed within a context associated with the classic papers on industry evolution, paradigms, paradigm shifts, competition, and competitiveness. Findings \{$\backslash$textendash\} It is difficult to capture present shifts in such a fast-growing industry, but these shifts seem clear: the original entry of video games into the arcade sector that led to the industry and the demise of pinball; the development of the home cartridge and console that made the industry a home-based phenomenon; the entry of independent game-publishers that made the industry a two-tiered one; and the development of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) that changed the way games are played. Originality/value \{$\backslash$textendash\} The video game industry is an interesting one to follow. To an extent, its development characterizes our generation \{$\backslash$textendash\} fast paced, technologically oriented, and targeted toward the young and young at heart. This paper takes the subject away from a historical or anecdotal approach and places it within the context of industry evolution, paradigms, and paradigm shifts. It thus should be of value to students of not only video games, but also the evolution of rapidly growing industries and establishment of competitive advantages. },

Using a work computer for personal reasons deviates from many organizations\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} norms. In the current study, we surveyed employees at an educational institution and asked them to report how they use their computers at work. These respondents also answered questions related to their sensation seeking, impulsiveness, conscientiousness, and job satisfaction as well as demographic information. We found that people who use their computers in unproductive ways tend to be men, younger, more impulsive, and less conscientious. We also found that those who use their computers for riskier PUWC behaviors (like viewing sexual content) tended to have sensation seeking personalities.},

abstract = {A number of commentators have proposed adapting ele- ments derived from game mechanics to workplaces, to moti- vate employees via techniques that, the argument goes, have proven successful in a videogame context, and thus may have wider motivational applications. This general strategy has become grouped under the term “gamification”. I argue the gamification-of-work movement has at least two major pre- cursors, one in the Soviet Union of the early to mid 20th century, and another in American management of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The Soviet approach focused on games to increase productivity, via experiments ranging from purely competitive games directly tied to productivity, to attempts at morale-building via team games and work- place self-expression. The American management approach focused more strongly on a sense of childhood play, aim- ing to weaken the work/play split, but often with games and competition integrated into the framework. Neither ap- proach is identical to the gamification-of-work movement, but there exist significant overlaps, and thus both the his- torical movements themselves, and the critiques that have been directed at them, should be studied in order to bet- ter understand how to approach current attempts in light of past experiences.},

Forty-six Japanese university undergraduates participated. In pairs, one subject played English-language minigames for 10 minutes and another subject watched the games.

We found that although users expected voice to be an advance over text-based communication, in practice they found voice difficult to use. In particular, users experienced difficulties controlling the voice channel and these difficulties are indicative of usability and sociability problems with the configuration of the voice channel in some Xbox Live games. We argue that game developers will need to address these problems in order to realize the potential of voice in online multiplayer videogames. We believe these problems can be addressed by designing the voice channel so that socially salient information is made available to participants according to interactional affordances and constraints that are sensibly designed and well understood by users.},

A key aim of this work is to show that a large part of the required functionality can be developed in a way so that it is reusable for other applications such as shared whiteboards or networked computer games. Our method therefore consists of both an application dependent part that handles the specific tasks required for sharing 3D models, and of a number of generic services such as synchronization, scalable support for latecomers, and the ability to record and replay sessions. The generic services are based on an abstract media model and the RTP/I application level protocol for distributed interactive media. Any other application for a medium that shares this model and that uses RTP/I may reuse these generic services. We have implemented a prototype called TeCo3D demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}PC Game Rooms\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} were first popularized in Korea, although the concept is now becoming popular worldwide. PC Game Rooms provide users with high-performance PC connected to the high-speed internet, and access to computer games. However, PC Game Room users are exposed to various hazardous agents such as cigarette smoke in a confined environment, and thus it is likely that excessive PC Game Room use involves abnormal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as well as being associated with disturbed sleep or circadian rhythm. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the exposure to PAH was evaluated by measuring urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and 2-naphthol. The correlations between PC Game Room use and PAH exposure and plasma testosterone and LH levels were analysed in 208 young male Koreans. RESULTS: Urinary 1-OHP concentrations increased (P=0.0001) and plasma testosterone levels decreased (P=0.0153) significantly with increased duration of PC Game Room use. Correlation analysis showed that plasma testosterone concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with urinary 1-OHP (r=-0.22, P=0.0012) and 2-naphthol (r=-0.15, P=0.0308) concentrations. Moreover, these associations persisted after adjusting for other independent variables. However, the duration of PC Game Room use itself was not found to be an independent significant determinant of plasma testosterone level. Rather, PC Game Room use increased PAH exposure, which decreased plasma testosterone level. The younger age group (15-19 years) showed a more prominent decrease in plasma testosterone concentrations with increasing duration of PC Game Room use than the older age group (20-24 years) (r(2)=0.355, P=0.0301 versus r(2)=0.213, P=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that the excessive use of PC Game Rooms is related to an adverse impact on sex hormonal status in young male Koreans via PAH exposure. This effect was more prominent in the younger age group.},

The Advanced Energy and Material Systems Laboratory has designed, developed a prototype, and tested such a game platform survey tool, called Travel Activity Constraint Adaptation Simulation (TACA SIM). A main objective is investigating adaptability under the simulated situation of rapid fuel price. The computer game survey approach has the potential to capture real behavior data through a well-controlled experiment, because the participant experiences the survey as a role-play exploration. Feedback from participants confirms that TACA SIM collects data efficiently in an acceptable time while the participants enjoyed the experience. The authors propose that this gamed-based survey approach provides the basis for collecting and evaluating travel behavior data and adaptation behavior.},

We proposed special games and techniques to simplify learning and manipulating vibro-tactile patterns. The technique for manipulating vibro-tactile sequences is based on gesture recognition and spatial-temporal mapping for imaging vibro-tactile signals. After training, the tactons could be used as awareness cues or the system of non-verbal communication signals.},

This article argues that such an agreement is not necessary, and presents a Wittgensteinian approach to discussing game definitions. Instead of the common core approach used in most definitions, this article argues for an approach based on language-games. The common core approach is based on a limited number of shared core attributes, while the language-game approach is based on the idea of family resemblances. The language-game approach sees the cycle of redefinition as a hermeneutic circle that advances our understanding of games. This article also clarifies the distinction between nominal and real definitions and shows how they serve different purposes. With the approach suggested here, the focus in research can shift from the essential attributes of games to understanding definitions as tools for practical purposes.},

abstract = {<p>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive video games (combined with stationary cycling) on health-related physical fitness and exercise adherence in comparison with traditional aerobic training (stationary cycling alone). College-aged males were stratified (aerobic fitness and body mass) and then assigned randomly to experimental (n = 7) or control (n = 7) conditions. Program attendance, health-related physical fitness (including maximal aerobic power (VO2 max), body composition, muscular strength, muscular power, and flexibility), and resting blood pressure were measured before and after training (60\%-75\% heart rate reserve, 3 d/week for 30 min/d for 6 weeks). There was a significant difference in the attendance of the interactive video game and traditional training groups (78\% \{$\backslash$textpm\} 18\% vs. 48\% \{$\backslash$textpm\} 29\%, respectively). VO2 max was significantly increased after interactive video game (11\% \{$\backslash$textpm\} 5\%) but not traditional (3\% \{$\backslash$textpm\} 6\%) training. There was a significantly greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure after interactive video game (132 \{$\backslash$textpm\} 6 vs. 123 \{$\backslash$textpm\} 6 mmHg) than traditional (131 \{$\backslash$textpm\} 7 vs. 128 \{$\backslash$textpm\} 8 mmHg) training. There were no significant changes in body composition after either training program. Attendance mediated the relationships between condition and changes in health outcomes (including VO2 max, vertical jump, and systolic blood pressure). The present investigation indicates that a training program that links interactive video games to cycle exercise results in greater improvements in health-related physical fitness than that seen after traditional cycle exercise training. It appears that greater attendance, and thus a higher volume of physical activity, is the mechanism for the differences in health-related physical fitness.

Although most of these existing works focus on game adaptation based on player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s performance, affective state experienced by the players could play a key role in gaming experience and may provide a useful indicator for a DDA mechanism. In this article, an affect-based DDA was designed and implemented for computer games. In this DDA mechanism, a player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s physiological signals were analyzed to infer his or her probable anxiety level, which was chosen as the target affective state, and the game difficulty level was automatically adjusted in real time as a function of the player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s affective state. Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and several physiological indices were explored to determine their correlations with anxiety. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the affect-based DDA on game play by comparing it with a performance-based DDA. This is the first time, that is known, that the impact of a real-time affect-based DDA has been demonstrated experimentally.},

abstract = {Research has shown that exposure to violent video games causes increases in aggression, but the mechanisms of this effect have remained. elusive. Also, potential differences in short-term and long term exposure are not well understood. An initial correlational study shows that video game violence exposure (VVE) is positively correlated with self-reports of aggressive behavior and that this relation is robust to controlling for multiple aspects of personality. A tab experiment showed that individuals low in VVE behave more aggressively after playing a violent video game than after a nonviolent game but that those high in VVE display relatively high levels of aggression regardless of game content. Mediational analyses show that trait hostility, empathy, and hostile perceptions partially account for the VVE, effect on aggression. These findings suggest that repeated exposure to video game violence increases aggressive behavior in part via changes in cognitive and personality factors associated with desensitization.},

Male undergraduates (N = 36) were assigned to a high aggressive or low aggressive video-game priming condition. After training, they played Metal Gear Solid(TM), which allows players to advance by using stealth, violence, or both. Participants in the high aggressive priming condition used significantly more violent action during game play and reported more hostility than those in the low aggressive priming condition. Heart rate was correlated with feelings of hostility. These findings indicate that both aggressive priming and use of game violence influence arousal and negative affect and might increase behavioral aggression.},

Like-minded contemporaries R.

Wilson claims that these criticisms rest on misunderstandings of Kripke and that, when correctly understood, Kripke's interpretation stands up to them well. In particular, Wilson defends Kripke's Wittgenstein against the charge of "non-factualism" about meaning. However, Wilson has not appreciated the full significance of McDowell's criticism. I use a brief exploration of Kripke's analogy between Wittgenstein and Hume to put this significance in sharp relief. It emerges that McDowell's response to Kripke's Wittgenstein account of meaning is in important respects analogous to Kant's response to Hume's account of causality, par- ticularly Kant's complaint that Hume reduced the objective necessity of the causal nexus to a merely subjective necessity. In the same way Kripke's Wittgenstein reduces the objective normative force of meanings to a "quasi-subjective," community-relative status.},

abstract = {Pervasive games break the boundary between digital and physical to make use of elements in the real world as part of the game. One form of pervasive games are locative mobile games, which utilize physical movement as game control. To facilitate eyes-free interaction during play, these games benefit from exploring sound- based content. However, it is currently unclear what type of sound- based interaction is feasible to the general audience. Another consideration is which sound design strategies best support the goal of situated experiences, and how to design sound that supports game experiences drawing upon location-awareness, and intermixing virtual content with physical reality. A first generation of locative mobile games is already commercially available. The present contribution analyzes seven commercially available locative games (Ingress; Shadow Cities; Zombies, Run!; Inception the App; The Dark Knight Rises Z+; CodeRunner) and summarizes the sound design strategies employed to contextualize game content in real-world. Comparison to current themes in contextualized audio research indicates similarities but also challenges some assumptions regarding audio-heavy gameplay. The findings illustrate the need for simplicity regarding audio challenges, but generally confirm the view of audio-based gameplay as a facilitator of mobility. Sound is also centrally involved in shaping contextualized experiences, forging links between the physical and digital world, and indexing game content to context through functionality, verbal references, spatialization, and remediation. The article discusses two complementary strategies to systematically manipulate the physical-digital relationship, and to promote strongly situated experiences.},

abstract = {Graphics-intensive computer games are no longer restricted to high-performance desktops, but are also available on a variety of portable devices ranging from notebooks to PDAs and mobile phones. Battery life has been a major concern in the design of both the hardware and the software for such devices. Towards this, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has emerged as a powerful technique. However, the showcase application for DVFS algorithms so far has largely been video decoding, primarily because it is computationally expensive and its workload exhibits a high degree of variability. This paper investigates the possibility of applying DVFS to interactive computer games, which to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before. We show that the variability in the workload associated with a popular First Person Shooter game like Quake II is significantly higher than video decoding. Although this variability makes game applications an attractive candidate for DVFS, it is unclear if DVFS algorithms can be applied to games due to their interactive (and hence highly unpredictable) nature. In this paper, we show using detailed experiments that (surprisingly) interactive computer games are highly amenable to DVFS. Towards this we present a novel workload characterization of computer games, based on the game engine for Quake II. We believe that our findings might potentially lead to a number of innovative DVFS algorithms targeted towards game applications, exactly as video decoding has motivated a variety of schemes for DVFS.

First, they are the shining proponents of cutting edge virtuality, embodying the alluring unreality of something erroneously conceived of existing on the other side of a screen.

However, very little objective evidence is available yet on the matter. This study was conducted to identify factors that influence surgeons\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} performance, as measured by a virtual reality computer simulator for laparoscopic surgery. Methods: This study included 25 surgical residents who had limited experience with laparoscopic surgery, having performed fewer than 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The participants were registered according to their gender, hand dominance, and experience with computer games. All of the participants performed 10 repetitions of the six tasks on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) within 1 month. Assessment of laparoscopic skills was based on three parameters measured by the simulator: time, errors, and economy of hand movement. Results: Differences in performance existed between the compared groups. Men completed the tasks in less time than women (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), but there was no statistical difference between the genders in the number of errors and unnecessary movements. Individuals with right hand dominance performed fewer unnecessary movements (p = 0.045, Mann-Whitney test), and there was a trend toward better results in terms of time and errors among the residence with right hand dominance than among those with left dominance. Users of computer games made fewer errors than nonusers (p = 0.035, Mann-Whitney test). Conclusions: The study provides objective evidence of a difference in laparoscopic skills between surgeons differing gender, hand dominance, and computer experience. These results may influence the future development of training program for laparoscopic surgery. They also pose a challenge to individuals responsible for the selection and training of the residents.},

Three studies are reported that explore the influence of gaming uncertainty on engagement with computer-based learning games. In the first study, children (10-11 years) played a simple maths quiz. Participants chose their preferred reward for a correct answer prior to seeing each question. They could either receive a single point or toss an animated coin to receive 2 points for heads or none for tails. A preference for the uncertain option was revealed and this increased during the quiz. The second study explored the discourse around learning when pairs of participants (13-14 years) competed against the computer in a science quiz. Progress depended on the acquisition of facts but also on the outcomes of throwing dice. Discourse was characterised by a close intermingling of learning and gaming talk without salient problematic constructions regarding fairness when losing points due to gaming uncertainty. A final experiment explored whether, in this type of game, the uncertainty provided by the gaming component could influence players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} affective response to the learning component. Electrodermal activity (EDA) of 16 adults was measured while they played the quiz with and without the element of chance provided by the dice. Results showed EDA when answering questions was increased by inclusion of gaming uncertainty.

From the fall of 2004 to the spring of 2005, Jennifer Jenson and Suzanne de Castell\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s EGG (Education, Gender and Gaming) project carried out a gaming club for girls at a local elementary school in the Greater Toronto Area.

At one point in the footage, a gaming session between five girls is interrupted when two boys enter the scene and try to hijack their play. Using the MAP (Multimodal Application Program, developed by Suzanne de Castell and Jennifer Jenson) tool to visually chart and analyze the co-ordinated reactions of the girls as they put down their controllers and hold their bodies immobile during the boys\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} disruption, this paper explores the tenuous relationship to video games these girls enjoy, even within a space ostensibly devoted to their play.},

The author argues that this is a serious omission that debases the expressive and communicative possibilities of interactivity.

abstract = {In third-generation (3G) wireless data networks, repeated requests for popular data items can exacerbate the already scarce wireless spectrum. In this paper, we propose an architectural and protocol framework that allows 3G service providers to host efficient content distribution services. We offload the spectrum intensive task of content distribution to an ad hoc network. Less mobile users (resident subscribers) are provided incentives to cache popular data items, while mobile users (transit subscribers) access this data from resident subscribers through the ad hoc network. Since the participants of this data distribution network act as selfish agents, they may collude to maximize their individual payoff. Our proposed protocol discourages potential collusion scenarios. In this architecture, the goal (social function) of the 3G service provider is to have the selfishly motivated resident subscribers service as many data requests as possible. However, the choice of which set of items to cache is left to the individual user. The caching activity among the different users can be modeled as a market sharing game. In this work, we study the Nash equilibria of market sharing games and the performance of such equilibria in terms of a social function. These games are a special case of congestion games that have been studied in the economics literature. In particular, pure strategy Nash equilibria for this set of games exist. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for a special case, while it is NP-hard to do so in the general case. As for the performance of Nash equilibria, we show that the price of anarchy-the worst case ratio between the social function at any Nash equilibrium and at the social optimum-can be upper bounded by a factor of 2. When the popularity follows a Zipf distribution, the price of anarchy is bounded by 1.45 in the special case where caching any item has a positive reward for all players. We prove that the selfish behavior of computationally bounded agents converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium in a finite number of improvements. Furthermore, we prove that, after each agent computes its response function once using a constant factor approximation algorithm, the outcome of the game is within a factor of O(log n) of the optimal social value, where n is the number of agents.

abstract = {Various forms of play emerge around computer games. These types of play, known as out-of-game play or extrinsic play, take place beyond the original game context. Despite their significant contribution to the overall play experience, they are often neglected by the game research community. Conventional game theories such as ludology and narratology do not provide an insightful account of the sociocultural aspects of game play. Therefore, in this article, we report our observations and investigations into different forms of extrinsic play activities in an online virtual setting. Founded on activity theory, we articulate theoretical models that explicate game play in a sociocultural context. Our findings reveal that extrinsic play constitutes reflective play and expansive play, which transform the play activity and transport the players beyond the original boundary of play.},

abstract = {Background. Many patients have difficulty interpreting risks described in statistical terms as percentages. Computer game technology offers the opportunity to experience how often an event occurs, rather than simply read about its frequency. Objective. To assess effects of interactive graphics on risk perceptions and decisions. Design. Electronic questionnaire. Participants and setting. Respondents (n = 165) recruited online or at an urban hospital. Intervention. Health risks were illustrated by either static graphics or interactive game-like graphics. The interactive search graphic was a grid of squares, which, when clicked, revealed stick figures underneath. Respondents had to click until they found a figure affected by the disease. Measurements. Risk feelings, risk estimates, intention to take preventive action. Results. Different graphics did not affect mean risk estimates, risk feelings, or intention. Low-numeracy participants reported significantly higher risk feelings than high-numeracy ones except with the interactive search graphic. Unexpectedly, respondents reported stronger intentions to take preventive action when the intention question followed questions about efficacy and disease severity than when it followed perceived risk questions (65\% v. 34\%; P < 0.001). When respondents reported risk feelings immediately after using the search graphic, the interaction affected perceived risk (the longer the search to find affected stick figures, the higher the risk feeling: \{\oe\}\{$\backslash$r A\} = 0.57; P = 0.009). Limitations. The authors used hypothetical decisions. Conclusions. A game-like graphic that allowed consumers to search for stick figures affected by disease had no main effect on risk perception but reduced differences based on numeracy. In one condition, the game-like graphic increased concern about rare risks. Intentions for preventive action were stronger with a question order that focused first on efficacy and disease severity than with one that focused first on perceived risk.},

The correct application of these principles and techniques produces filmed content that is more engaging, compelling and absorbing for the viewer. 3D computer games employ virtual cameras in order to provide the player with an appropriate view of the game world. These virtual cameras can simulate all of the functionality of their real-world counterparts yet little effort is usually made to incorporate cinematographic techniques and principles into their operation. We introduce CameraBots, autonomous camera operators modelled closely on the non-player characters (NPCs) or bots already present in many games. CameraBots can perform a larger set of operations than their real-world counterparts since they are not subject to the same physical restraints. Thus, cinematographic principles can be applied to camera work with relative ease by reusing bot program code already present. Our system contains a director module and a cinematographer module which together are responsible for coordinating the CameraBots in a manner consistent with cinematography rules and practice. It is designed in a modular manner such that it may be applied to numerous computer games with little modification.},

In general, two forms of activities exist that correspond with engagement: solitary, non-structured, and non-cooperative pursuits, often without adult supervision (e.g., playing video games, watching television) and highly structured, collaborative activities that are under the guidance of a competent set of adults (i.e., structured extracurricular activities, or SEAs). Although large amounts of time spent in unstructured activities is related to negative psychosocial outcomes, participation in SEAs has been related to a variety of positive outcomes for students. This paper reviews current research regarding adolescent participation in SEAs and its effects on academic and personal-social variables (i.e., self-concept, life satisfaction), as well as potential preventive effects for youths considered to be "at-risk" for negative developmental outcomes. The paper also examines research investigating the potential benefits and shortcomings of different types of SEAs. Finally, suggestions for future research and school-based preventive intervention are presented.},

To date, no reliable data for this phenomenon in Germany exists. In the present study, the excessive usage of computer and video games is seen as a rewarding behavior which can, due to learning mechanisms, become a prominent and inadequate strategy for children to cope with negative emotions like frustration, uneasiness and fears. In the survey, 323 children ranging in age from 11 to 14 years were asked about their video game playing behavior. Criteria for excessive computer and video game playing were developed in accordance with the criteria for dependency and pathological gambling (DSM-IV, ICD-10). Data show that 9.3\% (N = 30) of the children fulfill all criteria for excessive computer and video game playing. Furthermore, these children differ from their class mates with respect to watching television, communication patterns, the ability to concentrate in school lectures and the preferred strategies coping with negative emotions. In accordance with findings in studies about substance-related addiction, data suggest that excessive computer and video game players use their excessive rewarding behavior specifically as an inadequate stress coping strategy.},

Our analysis reveals multiple stages of technological innovations and changes of market leadership and industry standards during a relatively short history of the industry. The industry exhibits six generations: of technological changes in video game consoles and complementary products, with each generation represented by a new set of competitors, dominant designs, and market leaders out-competing the leaders of the prior generation. Our analysis confirms the efficacy of traditional tenets of successful strategic management in a network-based industry, such as the importance of technological innovation, building entry barriers, protecting firm-specific assets, competitive pricing, brand recognition, and effective channel management. These traditional strategies, however, should be geared to achieve new strategic goals, such as building installed base and a network of complementary products, that are critical success factors in competing in a network-based industry.},

With this in mind, this paper provides a concise overview of four aspects affecting networking in MCGs. First, networking resources (bandwidth, latency, and computational power) set the technical boundaries within which the MCG must operate. Second, distribution concepts encompass communication architectures (peer-to-peer, client/server, server-network), and both data and control architectures (centralized, distributed, replicated). Third, scalability allows the MCG to adapt to the resource changes parametrization. Finally, security aims at fighting back against cheating and vandalism, which are common in online gaming.},

abstract = {Much research has described the various practices needed of gaining access and participation in multi-user game communities. Cheat sites are a continuation of game communities where players engage in knowledge building about game related challenges. In this paper we analyze the cheat sites created by players for a tween virtual world called Whyville.net, which encourages youth to participate in a range of social activities and play casual science games. Through analysis we created typologies for both the cheats and sites related to science content. Further, a case study of an exemplary cheat site elaborates on how some player-generated sites work to build knowledge of Whyville. Finally, investigation of over a hundred player-written articles illuminates how Whyvillians contest different practices of cheating and how cheating affects the virtual world. Implications of these findings as cultural artifacts of the game community and as guides for designing informal online learning activities are discussed.},

abstract = {Tom Bissell is a prizewinning writer who published three widely acclaimed books before the age of thirty-four. He is also an obsessive gamer who has spent untold hours in front of his various video game consoles, playing titles such as Far Cry 2, Left 4 Dead, BioShock, and Oblivion for, literally, days. If you are reading this flap copy, the same thing can probably be said of you, or of someone you know.

Until recently, Bissell was somewhat reluctant to admit to his passion for games. In this, he is not alone. Millions of adults spend hours every week playing video games, and the industry itself now reliably outearns Hollywood. But the wider culture seems to regard video games as, at best, well designed if mindless entertainment.

Extra Lives is an impassioned defense of this assailed and misunderstood art form. Bissell argues that we are in a golden age of gaming\{$\backslash$textemdash\}but he also believes games could be even better. He offers a fascinating and often hilarious critique of the ways video games dazzle and, just as often, frustrate. Along the way, we get firsthand portraits of some of the best minds (Jonathan Blow, Clint Hocking, Cliff Bleszinski, Peter Molyneux) at work in video game design today, as well as a shattering and deeply moving final chapter that describes, in searing detail, Bissell\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s descent into the world of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game whose themes mirror his own increasingly self-destructive compulsions.

Blending memoir, criticism, and first-rate reportage, Extra Lives is like no other book on the subject ever published. Whether you love video games, loathe video games, or are merely curious about why they are becoming the dominant popular art form of our time, Extra Lives is required reading.},

In paired comparisons, parents reported significantly higher estimates of supervision time than children. Most parents either named an incorrect game or were not able to guess their child\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s favorite game. In 70\% of these incorrect matches, children described their favorite game as violent. Parents may underestimate their child\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s exposure to violence in electronic games. After playing the same electronic game as part of the study, parents reported significantly higher frustration than children. Higher frustration with game-playing could contribute to deficits in parental knowledge of children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s playing habits.},

This has led many people to assert that this may have a detrimental effect on individuals who play such games. Despite continuing controversy for over 15 years, there has been little in the way of systematic research. This article reviews the empirical studies in this area, including research methodologies such as the observation of free play, self-report methods, and experimental studies. The article argues that all the published studies on video game violence have methodological problems and that they only include possible short-term measures of aggressive consequences. The one consistent finding is that the majority of the studies on very young children-as opposed to those in their teens upwards-tend to show that children do became more aggressive after either playing or watching a violent video game. However, all of these come from the use of one particular research methodology (i.e., observation of children\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s free play).},

The videogame storyboard is marked up with a suitable domain-specific descriptive markup language, from which the different
art assets that are needed are referred to, and then the final executable videogame itself is automatically produced by processing
the marked storyboard with a suitable processor for such a language. This document-oriented approach opens new authoring
possibilities in videogame development and allows a rational collaboration between the different communities that participate
in the development process: game writers, artists, and programmers. We have implemented the approach in the context of the

In contrast to Rheinberg and Vollmeyer, the computer game was modified in order to have less extreme easy and difficult play levels. In the case of the difficult level it was now possible for the participants to have at least minimal success, whereas in Rheinberg and Vollmeyer\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s study the participants were almost unable to act. The results showed the expected effects for the easy and optimal levels but not for the difficult level. In contrast to expectations, the participants indicated high degrees of flow at the difficult level, A possible explanation for this finding is that extremely high demands in a game situation do not reduce the experience of flow under certain conditions. We concluded that games such as Roboguard are not suitable for flow research in general, but only for specific research questions.},

With a qualitative approach the structural characteristics, communication processes and interpretational patterns of collective gaming from the perspective of a clan member were researched. The results clearly illustrate the interconnections between real world and virtual world processes of communication and interaction. Clans can be classified as something in-between a hobby and a semi-professionally played sport, whereas the latter better corresponds to the self-concept of most of the interviewees. It was repeatedly noticed that many clans still have a virtual pioneer status. This allows active and committed clan members the possibility for individual design not only of game play, but also of the social and communicative organisation of the clan.},

The scenario- of the game is that of a player interacting with embodied fairy-tale characters in a 3D world via spoken dialogue (supplemented by graphical pointing actions) to solve various problems. The player himself cannot directly perform actions in the world, but interacts with the fairy-tale characters to have them perform various tasks, and to get information about the world and the problems to solve. Hence the role of spoken dialogue as the primary means of control is obvious and natural to the player. Naturally, this means that robust spoken language understanding becomes a critical component. To this end, the paper describes a semantic representation formalism and an accompanying parsing algorithm which works off the output of the speech recogniser\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s statistical language model. The evaluation shows that the parser is robust in the sense of considerably improving on the noisy output of the speech recogniser. },

abstract = {Increasing emotional engagement in 3-D interactive environments is a hard, but important problem. It is important
for its potential utility in increasing motivation, involvement, and engagement. These constructs are not only useful
for entertainment applications, but also impact training and edutainment applications due to the impact of emotions
on learning (Ulate, 2002; Wolfe, 2001). Many researchers have explored several techniques, including enhancing
the story content to stimulate emotional engagement, developing new algorithms for dynamically creating stunning
visual effects, and enhancing 3-D sound. Theatre and film have integrated many techniques that increase
engagement, attention, and emotional involvement. In this paper, I describe a set of new design techniques
integrated in an architecture that uses theatric and cinematic theories, specifically acting and screenwriting methods,
to stimulate and improve emotional engagement in 3-D interactive narratives. In this paper, I discuss two research
directions: (1) defining an interaction model for 3-D interactive narrative based on screenwriting theories, and (2)
developing an actor-based agent architecture to simulate believable actions within an interactive narrative. The
resulting architecture was implemented and tested within Mirage, an interactive story based on the Greek Tragedy
Electra. Based on the critiques from several participants, I deduce that the resulting architecture presents
significantly encouraging design techniques that can potentially increase emotional involvement and dramatic
content of an interactive desktop 3D VR experience. The system and approach presented in this paper demonstrates
an important new direction that adds to the set of techniques currently used and expand the design methodologies to
include methods from disciplines, such as performance arts, theatre, and film.},

abstract = {Communication within recreational computer-mediated settings has received less atten- tion than interaction in instrumental and organizational contexts. The present studycom- pared the socioemotional and task-oriented content of 5,826 text messages produced by participants of an online video game. The results suggest that participants produced sig- nificantly more socioemotional than task content. Consistent with predictions flowing from Social Information Processing Theory, the vast majority of messages were socio- emotional and positively valenced, despite the ostensible game objective of fighting other participants. Experience level played an important role in message production. More experienced participants produced both more positive and fewer negative socio- emotional messages than the less experienced and used more specialized language con- ventions (e.g., emoticons, scripted emotes, and abbreviations). The results are discussed in the context of previous research examining the effect of communication medium and interaction purpose on socioemotional and task message production.},

abstract = {Real-time rendering of realistic motion of fluids is a method that immerses a player into an interactive application such as computer games. Interaction of fluids with rigid bodies is important because fluids and rigid bodies move influencing each other. Fluid simulation based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is useful for rendering a visually plausible behaviour of fluids. However, due to the high computational cost of CFD, real-time rendering of fluids needs a fast simulation. This paper describes the particle-based fluid simulation based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics which includes interactions between fluids and rigid bodies, its fast implementation, and the manner of rendering a realistic water surface with optical phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and the Fresnel effect. The proposed method enables real-time animation of water with rigid body interaction.

abstract = {Teaching game production benefits computer science and engineering students, because game applications are usually complex interactive real-time systems, which are non-trivial to implement. Moreover, game production has a multi-disciplinary nature, because - in addition to software development - a game production process can include areas such as commercialization issues, game design, graphics design and implementation, sound engineering, level design, and story design. This kind of project environment teaches the development team to work and communicate efficiently. Having organized a variety of game production project courses in the Department of Information Technology in the University of Turku the students have implemented complete computer games or game proto-types. Our focus has been on teaching game related algorithms, software technologies and software engineering aspects of game production. We have used three different teaching approaches to organize the courses: (1) the traditional home assignment model where the students take full responsibility of organizing the production, (2) research seminars where the teachers act as direct customers for the production, and (3) intensive courses where the teachers participate in the production as coaches and mentors. In this presentation, we describe the three different teaching approaches, present them as formal process models, and compare them to commercial game production processes. Additionally, we consider the multi-disciplinary nature of game production and discuss how the issue can be taken into consideration in a study environment where the students are mainly technology oriented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel way of using real-time heart rate information to control a physically interactive biathlon (skiing and shooting) computer game. Instead of interfacing the game to an exercise bike or other equipment with speed output, the skiing speed is directly proportional to heart rate. You can freely choose the form of physical exercise, which makes it easier for people with different skill levels and backgrounds to play together. The system can be used with any exercise machine or form. To make playing meaningful instead of simply exercising as hard as you can, a high heart rate impedes the shooting part of the game by making the sight less steady. This balancing mechanism lets the player try out different tactics, varying from very slow skiing and sharp shooting to fast skiing and random shooting. The game has been evaluated in a user study with eight participants. The results show that heart rate interaction is fun and usable interaction method.},

Nevertheless, there are two ways in order to improve video games accessibility : the use of sound or the use of touch. Even if the latter turns out to be the main exploited solution, the use of touch remains substantial. Indeed, touch is the base of Braille learning and Braille knowledge is the only way for visually impaired persons to access written information alone without any technical help such as computer and vocal analysis [1]. This article introduces our works about tactile video games. It shows games like Snake or Maze, which can be played from a Braille display. Finally, these works have led us to think about the way to introduce tactile games as play aspect in Braille learning[2,3].},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite hundreds of studies, there is continuing debate about the extent to which violent video games increase aggression. Believers argue that playing violent video games increases aggression, but this stance is disputed by skeptics. The present study addressed believers' and skeptics' responses to summaries of scientific studies that do or do not present evidence for increased aggression after violent video game play.

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Participants (N = 662) indicated whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Afterwards, they evaluated two opposing summaries of fictitious studies on the effects of violent video play. They also reported whether their initial belief had changed after reading the two summaries and indicated again whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Results showed that believers evaluated the study showing an effect more favorably than a study showing no effect, whereas the opposite was observed for skeptics. Moreover, both believers and skeptics reported to become more convinced of their initial view. In contrast, for actual attitude change, a depolarization effect was found.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that biased assimilation of new information leads believers and skeptics to become more rather than less certain of their views. Hence, even when confronted with mixed and inconclusive evidence, the perceived gap between both sides of the argument increases.},

abstract = {The legitimacy of therapeutic mediations has long been asserted in care centres. Yet non verbal, body-oriented mediations appear to have retained a singular status, particularly in those psychiatric institutions concerned with the adolescent and the young adult. Traditional ergotherapy has adapted to the new mediators of the young (video games, multimedia, cinema, etc.). At the same time it has made a step in the direction of occupations which involve the physical body more explicitly - when any such association had usually been excluded from therapeutic mediations that privileged the verbal expression as the principal tool to restart the symbolisation process. We have set out to investigate the part such body-oriented mediations play, and whether they are a superior mean in dealing with patients resistant to other forms of assistance. We have concerned ourselves with the indoor climbing activities which take place in the out patient "care and study" department of the hospital (Clinique Dupre). We reason that the learning and safety aspects of indoor climbing permit to re-enact regressive phenomena associated to the repetition of early experiences of distress. Climbing as a mediation opens the therapeutic doors by allowing the physical resurrection of those early experiences which had yet to be symbolised.},

Design: Feasibility study. Settings: Community kindergartens around Israel and a tertiary pediatric pulmonary clinic. Participants: Healthy and asthmatic preschool children (age range, 2.0 to 6.5 years). Intervention: Multitarget interactive spirometry games including three targets: full inspiration before expiration, instant forced expiration, an long expiration to residual volume. Measurements and results: One hundred nine healthy, and 157 asthmatic children succeeded in performing adequate spirometry using a multitarget interactive spirometry game. American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory, Society spirometry criteria for adults for the start of the test, and repeatability were met. Expiration time increased with age (1.3 +/- 0.3 s at 3 years to 1.9 +/- 0.3 s at 6 years [+/- SD], p < 0.05). FVC and flow rates increased with age, while FEV1/FVC decreased. Healthy children had FVC and FEV1 values similar to those of previous preschool studies, but flows were significantly higher (> 1.5 SD for forced expiratory flow at 50\% of vital capacity [FEF50] and forced expiratory flow at 75\% of vital capacity, [FEF75] p < 0005). The descending part of the flow/volume curve was convex in 2.5- to 3.5-year-old patients, resembling that of infants, while in 5- to 6-year-old patients, there was linear decay. Asthma severity by Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines correlated with longer expiration time (1.7 +/- 0.4 s; p < 0.03) and lower FEF50 (32 to 63\%; p < 0.001) compared to healthy children. Bronchodilators improved FEV1 by 10 to 13\% and FEF50 by 38 to 56\% of baseline. Conclusions: Interactive respiratory games can facilitate spirometry in very young children, yielding results that conform to most of the ATS criteria established for adults and published data for healthy preschool children. Spirometric indexes correlated with degree of asthma severity.},

abstract = {Temporal language is often couched in spatial metaphors. English has been claimed to have two space!time metaphoric systems: the ego-moving metaphor, wherein the observer’s context progresses along the time-line towards the future, and the time-moving metaphor, wherein time is conceived of as a river or conveyor belt on which events are moving from the future to the past. In three experiments, we investigated the psychological status of these metaphors by asking subjects to carry out temporal inferences stated in terms of spatial metaphors. In Experiment 1, we found that subjects were slowed in their processing when the assertions shifted from one spatial metaphoric system to the other. In Experiment 2, we determined that this cost of shifting could not be attributed to local lexical factors. In Experiment 3, we again found this metaphor consistency effect in a naturalistic version of the study in which we asked commonsense time questions of passengers at an airport. The results of the three studies provide converging evidence that people use spatial metaphors in temporal reasoning. Implications for the status of metaphoric systems are discussed.},

Unlike historical accounts of the stimulating effects of art, such as men\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s arousal at the realism of Sansorino\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s nude Venus, or Pliny\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s account of a man\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s infatuation with the sculpture of Aphrodite of Caridos, sex in games exists within a cyber-culture that offers access to a broad range of erotic, graphic and specialized pornographic materials. The authenticity of digitally mediated experiences \{$\backslash$textendash\} desire-driven assemblages of the social and technological \{$\backslash$textendash\} is given consideration in terms of whether the perceptual nature of sexuality is undergoing a transformation, allowing for wider patterns of variation in erotic sub-cultures. This paper recognizes how these sub-cultures remain focused upon, and constructed around phallocentric fantasies and desires, but begins to reflect on how the substance of the body and the sexual object is continuing to shift and diversify.},

abstract = {Demographic trends in the United States suggest that the general public will become increasingly isolated from traditional consumptive uses of wildlife. This is correlated with nationwide decreases in hunter initiation and continuation. Because most state wildlife agencies derive a large portion of their funding from hunting-license sales, a decline in this source of revenue could have dramatic implications for future wildlife management programming. The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (IAFWA) developed the Hunting as a Choice (HAC) project to help its member state fish and wildlife agencies effectively address these trends. HAC products target nontraditional constituents (suburban 10-12-year-old children). As a marketing study, we assessed the effectiveness of HAC to determine whether computer-based educational products (website and computer game) could increase the interest of 10- to 12-year-old suburban children in hunting or hunter education classes. Nearly half of the 91 suburban school children in Jacksonville, Florida, exposed to the website and computer game requested more information about taking a hunter education course from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Participants also became more tolerant of other people who hunt.},

abstract = {This essay examines the relationship between player and diegetic sound FX in immersive computer game environments and how this relationship leads, in large part, to the contextualization of the player within the virtual world of the game. This contextualization presupposes a primarily sonically-based perception of objects and events in the world and, in a multi-player game, this ultimately leads to communication between players through the medium of diegetic sound. The players\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} engagement with, and immersion in, the game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s acoustic environment is the result of a relationship with sound that is technologically mediated. The game engine, for example, produces a range of environmental or ambient sounds and almost every player action has a corresponding sound. A variety of relevant theories and disciplines are assessed for the methodological basis of the points raised, such as film sound theory and sonification, and, throughout, the First-Person Shooter sub-genre is used as an exemplar. Such games include the \{$\backslash$guillemotleft\}Doom\{$\backslash$guillemotright\} and \{$\backslash$guillemotleft\}Quake\{$\backslash$guillemotright\} series, the \{$\backslash$guillemotleft\}Half-Life\{$\backslash$guillemotright\} series and derivatives and later games such as \{$\backslash$guillemotleft\}Left 4 Dead\{$\backslash$guillemotright\}. The combination of the acoustic environment, the interactive placement of the player \{$\backslash$textendash\} as embodied by his virtual, prosthetic arms \{$\backslash$textendash\} in the environment and the sonic relationships between players produces the acoustic ecology. An exposition of this multi-player communication and the resultant acoustic ecology and player immersion, is the main objective of the essay.},

Managing a guild, however, is notoriously difficult and many do not survive very long. In this paper, we examine some of the factors that could explain the success or failure of a game guild based on more than a year of data collected from five World of Warcraft servers. Our focus is on structural properties of these groups, as represented by their social networks and other variables. We use this data to discuss what games can teach us about group dynamics online and, in particular, what tools and techniques could be used to better support gaming communities.},

For this study the educational game Melo\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s World was created as an experimental platform.

Most existing consistency models and consistency maintenance mechanisms adopt a data-centric approach, which is not adequate for MPOGs. We advocate a human-centric approach, and propose a consistency model based on the similarity of the perceptions of different players. The implications of the proposed consistency model in game design are also discussed. In particular, a generic consistency maintenance mechanism for MPOGs is proposed.},

We extrapolate where the industry is going and what future synergies it is likely to contribute. We focus on behavior generation and other accomplishments that are relevant for training applications and especially for non-programmer authorship of content for training applications. We will argue that the gaming industry\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s modeling capabilities are currently of little theoretical interest but that pragmatically, the current accomplishments of the gaming industry can have a substantial positive impact on training and modeling and that this impact will increase over the next few years.

Frequency of VG use had no correlation with Ss\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} popularity among classmates, and frequency of VG use had slightly negative correlations with boys\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} SCAs. However, it was likely that the negative correlations were not due to the causal relation that VG use affected boys\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} SCAs, which supported the hypothesis, but rather the causal relation that VG use was affected by their abilities. Frequency of computer use (word processing or programming) had few correlations with SCAs.},

We present and test several adversarial heuristic search algorithms that are able to compute reasonable actions in those scenarios using short time controls. Tournament results indicate that a new algorithm for simultaneous move games which we. call "randomized alpha-beta search" (RAB) can be used effectively in the abstract combat application we consider.

abstract = {In computer games, tutoring systems are used for two purposes: (1) to introduce a human player to the mechanics of a game, and (2) to ensure that the computer plays the game at a level of playing strength that is appropriate for the skills of a novice human player. Regarding the second purpose, the issue is not to produce occasionally a weak move (i.e., a give-away move) so that the human player can win, but rather to produce not-so-strong moves under the proviso that, on a balance of probabilities, they should go unnoticed. This paper focuses on using adaptive game AI to implement a tutoring system for commercial games.(1) We depart from the novel learning technique \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}dynamic scripting\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and add three straightforward enhancements to achieve an \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}even game\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, viz. high-fitness penalising, weight clipping, and top culling. Experimental results indicate that top culling is particularly successful in creating an even game. Hence, our conclusion is that dynamic scripting with top culling can implement a successful tutoring system for commercial games.},

abstract = {Surgical simulation can provide great benefits to medicine by reducing the cost and duration of training and making the process more intuitive and informative. However, a simulation system imposes stringent requirements on the human-machine interface. A sense of touch greatly enhances the simulation experience, since much of the skill that a medical professional possesses is in his ability to explore and diagnose by touch. This sensory input carl be provided by an input device with force and/or tactile feedback. There are many technical challenges associated with the creation of a robust surgical-simulation system incorporating touch feedback. The medical application has unique needs that drive the design of the mechanism, the control scheme, the tissue deformation engine, and the overall system architecture and distribution of computation. This technology is riot yet mature; several companies are dedicated to creating various parts of a simulation system, but as yet there are no commercially available solutions that are cost effective. Interest in force-feedback devices is gaining momentum in the commercial sector, however, notably in the area of personal computer games. We believe this interest will drive down the cost of components and spur research efforts so that better, more cost-effective force-feedback devices will be available to the medical community for use in widespread surgical-simulation systems.},

We predicted that playing a violent video game using an IVET platform would lead to increased presence and aggressive feelings and behavior compared to playing on a less immersive desktop platform. The results of two experiments supported this hypothesis. The data suggest that presence mediated the relationship between playing platform and aggressive feelings but not the relationship between playing platform and aggressive behavior. Finally, we explored the utility of using cardiovascular measures within this research paradigm.},

The main goal of the programme is to sharpen their problem and health consciousness concerning addiction and pleasure seeking. The programme was evaluated by a longitudinal study. At three given times, the 12- to 15-year-old pupils of the experimental classes were interviewed by standardized self-completion questionnaires (n = 2,267). The control classes were submitted to two surveys (n = 586). The study was carried out in the areas of Innsbruck (Austria), Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) and South Tyrol (Italy). Not all pupils were able to keep their intentions submitted in their contract, but 4 of 5 pupils had at least one positive experience with the renunciation (82\%). There were \{$\backslash$textquoteleft\}overall effects\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}: The actual renunciation of the pupils was much higher than stated in their agreement. The experimental group showed significant reduction effects for pupils, who had successfully reduced or stopped use of a substance or medium. In a further step, it should be explored whether the programme is suitable also for older groups, i.e. for pupils older than 15 years. Moreover, the long-term effects of the programmes should be tested.},

Soldiers, as well as firefighters and physicians, now use them as part of their training. They are not playing Mortal Kombat or Madden football; rather they are using games to mirror everyday situations they encounter in their work. Ever since flight schools used simulation as a method for training pilots, the value of simulated activity has overlapped with the necessity of functional training. In contrast to its stereotype as stodgy and out-of-touch, the military embraced game-based simulations earlier than other institutions, according to gaming industry observers. The effectiveness of games in training and delivering content lies at the heart of what is called the "serious games" movement, which is led by advocates who believe that games can be effective training tools. A Serious Games summit was recently held in the Washington, DC, area to showcase many of the game elements that are being used to train the military and other professionals. While some fear gaming in the school or workplace, many games already play an educational role. One could argue that the increasing sophistication and the multiplicity of scenarios used in games are becoming more like a simulated environment and less like a game played merely for escape.},

How- ever, we show that such actions are actually far from superfluous; they play a valuable role in improving human performance. We argue that traditional accounts are limited because they regard action as having o single function: to change the world. By recognizing a second function of action-an tion-we epistemic func- can explain many of the actions that a traditional model cannot. Al- though our argument is supported by numerous examples specifically from Tetris, we outline how the new category of epistemic action can be incorporated into theories of action more generally.},

This online study is the first ever to assess what structural characteristics (if any) are important to a group of self-selected video game players (n = 382). The main variables examined were sound, graphics, background and setting, duration of game, rate of play, advancement rate, use of humor, control options, game dynamics, winning and losing features, character development, brand assurance, and multi-player features. Although there were many major gender differences, one of the main overall findings was the importance of a high degree of realism (i.e., realistic sound, graphics, and setting). Other important characteristics included a rapid absorption rate, character development, the ability to customize the game, and multi-player features. Suggestions for future research are outlined.},

abstract = {Agency has long been considered one of the core pleasures of interacting with digital games. Recent treatments of agency in games culture and game design have grown increasingly concerned with providing the player with limitless freedom to act. While this describes one form of pleasure, in narratively focused games it has the unfortunate consequence of pitting the agency of the player against the will of the designer. We contend that for narrative games it is valuable to refocus our definitions of agency on the notion of meaning, and propose a treatment of agency that emphasises communicative commitments. This form of agency draws on ideas from speech act theory, and relies on a degree of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}communicative competence\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} on the part of both the game designer and player in order to function. We discuss mechanisms for training players in the necessary literacies needed to commit to meanings in games, and provide an example analysis of a game that successfully accomplishes this task. },

abstract = {Decades of research have demonstrated that exposure to violence on television can cause increases in aggression. The recent emergence of violent video games has raised new questions regarding the effects of violent media. The General Aggression Model (GAM) predicts that exposure to violent media increases aggressive behavior through one of three primary pathways (arousal, cognitions, and affect). Past psychophysiological research has supported GAM but has been limited to examining arousal-related variables. Recent advances in social neuroscience have opened the door to investigations of exposure to violent media on cognitive and affective components and their neurocognitive underpinnings. Neuroscience tools have the potential to provide answers to the new questions posed by recent advances in media technology.

Design: Cross-sectional cohort design. Participants and Setting: Seven hundred forty-three high school students from 2 inner-city public schools and 1 private school. Methods: Students completed a self-administered questionnaire that addressed time spent in physical activity, time spent in sedentary pursuits, musculoskeletal pain, and psychosocial issues and were also measured for height and weight. Main Outcome Measure: Level of physical activity (low, moderate, high). Results: There were more girls than boys in the low and moderate physical activity groups and more boys than girls in the high activity group. Ordinal logistic regression showed that increased time spent in "productive sedentary behavior" (reading or doing homework and working on computers) was associated with increased physical activity (odds ratio, 1.7-1 95\% confidence interval, 1.2-2.4), as was time spent working (odds ratio, 13;95\%confidence interval, 1.2-1.4). Time spent watching television and playing video games was not associated with decreased physical activity. Conclusions: Physical activity was not inversely associated with watching television or playing video games, but was positively associated with productive sedentary behavior and part-time work. Some students appear capable of managing their time better than others. Future studies should explore the ability of students to manage their time and also determine what characteristics are conducive to better time management.},

abstract = {In this study, we introduce the differential equation model which can explain some hierarchical growth processes. This model is based on the assumptions that some growth processes can be devided into plural stages, and that in a given stage, increasing speed of population (human or otherwise) depends on the size of population in the previous stage. For example, urbanization process can be devided into residential land development stage and building up stage, and the expanding speed of the built-up area depends on the residential development area, In accordance with these assumptions, we formulate the simultaneous differential equations, then calculate their general solutions. We consider that this model can describe the sales of the video game machines, because the process of buying them has following two stages, first a person wants to buy the machine, then he actually buys it, In addition, the person who gets the game machine will buy some video game softwares. Deriving new model with these thought, we can confirm that the model can explain the sales of video game machines well especially shortly after the machine\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s being put on the market. This consequence indicates that the hierarchical model is appropriate for the explanation of the growth tendency of the beginning period. Furthermore, the application of this model to explain the sudden growth in a growth process is proposed in this paper. When a price reduce campaign is launched, the sales of the machines shows a tendency of sudden increase. The model can explain this change by adding only two parameters to the original model. Our model has so simple structure that it will be able to represent some underlying mechanisms of various growth processes.},

With the increasing of complexity of the scene, the amount of data to be rendered becomes larger. At the same time, the modern graphics card has a more powerful rendering ability, so many traditional terrain rendering algorithms can not fulfill the requirements. A new algorithm was proposed that was friendly for modern graphics card. The algorithm also used the regular height map grid as terrain data. Terrain data was tiled and organized by quad tree. Each tile covered a part of terrain with different detail. The method used which Mipmap used to refine the mesh, and there was no remising in real time rendering. To balance the load between CPU and GPU, many tiles used at a high frequency were cached in GPU, which could reduce the bandwidth requirements significantly. The results show the algorithm which is well-suited for recent GPU can not only meet the requirements of detail but also reach a higher frame rate.

abstract = {Applied research will be presented from a qualitative study that highlights high school students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} learning and use of several game interfaces, describing how particular affordances and game interface designs can encourage learning. Inductive generalizations from several \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}commercial\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} games for good, including Civilization IV, Making History: The Calm \& the Storm, and RollerCoaster Tycoon describe patterns of learning among game players, showing how the design of in-game visualizations either led to success or failure to learn to use basic game controls. This analysis, inspired by ethnomethodology and grounded theory, sought patterns from gathered video data of student gameplay to highlight learning episodes and patterns of interface use. Patterns in affordance use (uptake of a perceived action potential) during collaborative gameplay reveal relationships among the video game interface and player behavior, giving focus to how an interface design can guide game player interaction. In line with Csikszentmihalyi\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s concept of flow, a proper balance of difficulty (between feelings of boredom, and too much difficulty) encouraged player engagement and learning. As evidenced in transcripts of collaborative gameplay, feelings of frustration with a game interface often led students to abandon in-game tasks, as did boredom with a given task. However, frustrated goal achievement often led to the re-negotiation of in-game strategies: an indication of engagement. Additionally, games that presented information using multiple channels encouraged learning, as did the use of specific visualizations such as the animation of in-game objects. Finally, a discussion of the affordances created by different game designs will offer educators and game designers guidelines to encourage motivated gameplay.},

Right-to- movements were digitally transformed for the use of a computer game, Participants were treated for 5 weeks, and outcome measures included range of motion (ROM) grip strength, edema, and level of interest Results. Results showed significant improvement in ROM, grip strength, and edema across 5 weeks for all participants. Although no significant differences were found between the true groups in ROM, grip strength, and enema, the computer-aided group showed significantly more interest in treatment than did the brush machine group. Finally the interaction between treatment group and the attitude toward computers was not significant. Conclusions. These results-indicate the potential for more interesting motor treatment and rehabilitation of the wrist through the use of computer games, The efficacy of using computers in occupational therapy clinics needs further investigation.},

abstract = {As the contemporary heirs of popular music or cinema, computer games are gradually taking over the mar-kets of entertainment. Much like cinema and music, computer games are taking the spotlight in another front \{$\backslash$textendash\} that which blames them for encouraging unethical behaviors. Apparently, computer games turn their users into blood thirsty zombies with a computer game learnt ability of aiming with deadly precision. The goal of this paper is to pay attention to the ethical nature of computer games, in order to understand better the ways we can evaluate their morality in western cultures providing a framework to understand some of these concerns. This paper poses questions about the ontology of games and their ethical meaning, in an attempt to give ethical theory a word in the analysis of computer games.},

abstract = {The computer game use in education has been growing as a learning facilitator. What is it? educational environment allows teachers to be co-author of an online game based on cards which uses a common sense knowledge base. It also allows teachers to choose language according to their students\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} culture and needs providing them with suitable language. The environment also allows researchers to collect common sense knowledge. Every user interaction in each editor\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s module and player\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s module generates a new common sense statement which is stored into Brazilian Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS-BR) project knowledge base. A study case was conducted with teachers and students from two different Brazilian public schools. Results demonstrate there is a large potential of the use of this environment in real classes and the methodology to collect common sense statements naturally through a web game.},

abstract = {Software engineers use system visualization mainly in two domains: algorithm visualization and system visualization, and both of these are often animated. In this paper we provide a generic link between the specification and animation of complex object-oriented reactive systems, which constitute one of the most important and difficult classes of systems. The link and its methodology form a basis for communication between standard reactive specification tools and standard animation tools. Reactive Animation can be used in a wide range of applications: computer games, navigation and traffic systems, interactive scientific visualization. Reactive Animation helps make the programming of such applications more reliable, expeditious and natural to observe and comprehend. We illustrate two examples: a complex biological model of thymic T-cell behavior and a traffic simulation(1).},

The work is conducted using conceptual analysis, by applying the Communicative Action Theory as the framework. The analytical framework is further expanded by a model of interaction forms, which delineates the categories of perceivable interaction forms. The main contribution of this work is in illustrating the available interaction forms and in analysing them based on the various functions they support. The successful application of the social theory framework as a tool for analysing interaction forms indicates the importance of combining the research efforts of various disciplines and practices in order to achieve more comprehensive results in the area of interaction design for multiplayer games.},

@article{Biddle2004,
abstract = {There is growing concern over the effects of sedentary lifestyles on the health of young people. Recent rapid increases in juvenile obesity have received a great deal of attention in the scientific and popular press and have been attributed partly to television viewing, computer games and other sedentary behaviours. These are thought to compete with physical activity. There is a \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}moral panic\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} concerning the \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}couch kids\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} culture in modern western society. Project STIL (Sedentary Teenagers and Inactive Lifestyles) at Loughborough University is investigating \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}what young people do\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and focuses on active and inactive pursuits chosen in their Leisure time. The following issues are addressed in this paper with specific reference to young people: how do we define \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}sedentary behaviour\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} and do key sedentary behaviours displace physical activity? Are key sedentary behaviours obesogenic? What are the secular trends for children and youth for TV viewing? Our results for young people suggest that: 1. TV viewing and video-game playing are Largely uncorrelated with physical activity, suggesting that there is time for both. 2. meta-analytic findings show that body fatness is not related in any clinically meaningful way with key sedentary behaviours 3. although more children and youth have greater access to TVs than in previous generations, the amount of TV watched per head has not changed for 40 years. Preliminary findings from Project STIL suggest that inactivity is more complex than we sometimes think. Indeed, measures of \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}couch potato-ism\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}, such as TV viewing, may be inappropriate markers of inactivity.},

Due to these limitations, though cellular network and WPAN are being used in handset together, the services using both networks are not so popular until now. This paper presents a platform design integrating cellular network and WPAN and its application to the mobile game service. To develop services and applications which utilize cellular network and WPAN, we discuss the WPAN platform for handset. Various aspects are considered on the connection, which can expand the area of mobile services and applications. An illustrative application of this platform is introduced as a mobile game service. In the proposed game service, downloading games or game items, managing players, etc. are provided using cellular network. The actual game traffic between players utilizes WPAN. As shown in the proposed game service design, various applications are being expected through the WPAN platform.},
